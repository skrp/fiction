! Clank clak clik
Todd ran his hand down lockers lining empty-halls

15 Minutes past the Bell
Point-of-no-return to class

Any student this late gets writ-up
Ironically worse than not-arriving-to-class-at-all

`Devil has idle hands when works harvest
Todd inspired himself to no avail

His purpose in the basement
Below, front the door he planned to open 

Latency became mounted by endless-anticipation
Energy from day-dreaming now a hurdle
Aun compelled him towards the opposite direction

The thump of Todd's feet steady
Step-after-step up stairs to higher floors

A peace appreciated
In a place only-ever bustling

The few rays of the sun bore thru only to expose dust-polluted air
_

Mellow ambience shattered
Patters of running-feet charged towards his direction
From around the corner

Fortune placed Todd directly opposite the girls restroom

Distance leapt in one bound
He rushed to the last stall

Todd let out a cocky smirk
An instictual-ingenuity to hide in the girls

!! KAK

The cracked-seat broke plunging his left-foot ankle-deep into hour-old piss & shit

The door quietly opened
Someone made an attempt to open the first stall

A muffled-yell came from the hallway
'BEN WE KNOW YOUR IN THE GIRLS

!! BOOM

Heavy-legs-kicked-open-near-cracked-the-door-in-half

That unexpected fright broke unprecedented-pressure into full-release

!!! BRAPPPPPPPPPPUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSS
!!! PPPPUUUPPPPTTTTTUUUUPPPPP
!!! PPPPPLLLLQQQQQQIIIPPPLLLUUUUKKKKIII

The entire school vibrated
Eruptions of great-masses expounded essays in song

!!! GAWDDAMN BEN
!!! YOU SHOULDA SAID WHY
!!! YOU NEEDED tHe gah hiRls

A schoolhall-monitor hooted out for-the-entire-building-to-know
Announcement gagged-quiet
Gas particles bloomed-out in a thick cloud
_

The room silent after the door fell shut & resettled
All walls of the building rumbled again
This time in unanimous giggles

!! PAT
!! PAT
!! PAT

Ben kicked at the stall door braced-shut by legs
'Gonna make your fat-cunt-trap
'Eat that shit you scabby-bitch

Todd stepped out of the stall
'Back off

Ben turned to him more crazed

! YOU

Todd was swiftly tackled to the wall
Slamming hard as his soaked-foot slipped-out

Ben muffled as he struggled out his revenge
'You are the reason I got chased

'walk'n around
'like you weren't 
'skipping class

'a teacher notified
'the monitors and got me chased down

Todd maneuvered around using Ben's force against him
His forearms placed Ben in a locked-hold

After several curses & a long pause Ben surrendered
'Alright asshole
'You made your point

Todd pushed Ben off to a safe distance
A toilet flushed and another boy joined the scene in the girls restroom

'Sorry about that
Jordan blushed-out the awkward introduction
'Im sick

Today would haunt Ben's reputation
For a while they were content with breathing the compressed-gas in silence
_

Walls washed white layer-after-layer
Extenuated by dark recesses between the tiles
Unable to conceal deep-red marked graffiti symbols

Piss marked all to a feminine territory
If only the stain but mostly the smell

Curiosity here only met horrors
All repelled from investigations

Ben broke the silence
'This place is kinda creepy

Hot-box-gassed-up
No where to go until the class period ended

A sound tickled Todd's ear
An enchanting burr at the tail-ends of the echoes

Before he realized he was interested
Echoes drew him closer to the wall

Todd was startled then reaffirmed

'There is a hum
'That sounds like a whimper
'Can you hear it

Jordan put in as he neared
'Probably a god-damned-ghost

He yelled at the trash-can playfully
'School is hella-haunted
'sk-a-dick Bettsy burns-the-dick

'back in the 50s ...
Jordan started his story

The hum came from the metal-box next to the trashcan
Rust smeared as Todd opened the lid for better acoustics
The vent dropped to darkness

Todd spoke into the vent
'We can hear you

( need help help please help )

The sound came softened from great distance
But with a fullness-of-scream
That rips apart throat-lining

The communication so faint
Todd looked to the others for confirmation

( help us    please )

Jordan ventured
'Here
'we are here

'Where are you

( can you hear me  hello please help )

Jordan continued
'We hear you
'We will get the Principal

!!! nnnneeeeeeehhhhhhoooooooooooo

The shriek took all three back in a tight terror
Pitch-to-curl-ear-hairs in absolute revolution

Todd opened the lid with both his hands to shout down

'Who ever you are
'Where ever you are
'We will find you
'That is a promise

Todd left immediately
The others followed dazed

To them it seemed
A reckless commitment

At 10-min-to-the-bell the hall is at its most empty
Policy prohibits anyone out-in-the-hall

The trio made their way without obstruction
All Monitors would be back in their lounge on the couch

Todd led them confidently down lower floors

'I discovered a secret passage behind a door
'When I got lost my first-year fire-drill

'All year I been trying to work myself
'Up to this before graduation

'No chance ever came
'So today I promised
'I would make it happen

Todd was the only-one-he-knew who had seen that long-corridor
Despite years he still believed in what he had seen

'Since first-year
'I been planning how explore it

'Today is too much for coincidence
'That door will lead us there

Not to mention Todd felt empowered by company

Three boys followed the stairwells down
A small pack not-to-be-fucked-with

On-the-move breaking all violations
They were all-in since they left the girls

Crossed lengths of halls of the first year students

Todd continued
'When I got lost

'I felt someone calling out to me by-name
'I followed
'Tho less-than-a-handful knew my name

'I found a door at the end of the hall
'It was unlocked
'At first I only peaked in out of curiosity

'But at the back of the closet
'There was a light-source instead of shadow

'I had time to wander so I entered
'I discovered a long corridor

'The path went ahead for a long time
'It ended at a black hole in a wall

'I am sure it leads down
'But I forced myself to go back
'Before I got near enough to know

'Goddam-creepy-place

Todd looked ahead determined
The pent-up-forces now unleashed propelled him forward unstoppable

Thru the hall towards the basement
Moving around windows
One-at-a-time ninja-like
Till they got near the gym-lockers

Jordan expounded
Stirred with the brisk walk

'Shit-man
'Most my papers for school
'Were all about school history
'Lame-as-fk-mate 

'Yo tho 
'One caught me like

!daymn

'At center-city-library
'People all WTF
'You shoulda been there it was classic

'But the article caught me unexpected
'Bored, but try'n to look like
'I wasn't only there for the roof

'So Im thumb'n thru all these papers from the start
'To see when Driscol got famous the first time

'This floor is supposed to be the basement
'Right so with that-in-mind

'There was one article
'blow-your-mind-man

'A boy found pieced-up
'In a fishy satanic ritual

'Im like some lil muthrfkr
'Put this pulp in tryna-act-smart

'But !Daymn
'The newspaper was solid-legit

'The article said the janitor
'Alerted authorities from across the county
'They almost hung-up on him as nutt-case

'But the they heard him
'Get eaten da-fk alive
'Fleshy sounds & munching
'Huge masses of people chanting

'Man screaming 
'Kept alive past possible

'PoPo from all over the county stormed the place

'That shit all happened 
'according to multiple statements in the newspaper
'On the muthrfkn-second-basement floor

'First I took it considered Uni Hospital first-floor
'But then I remember from a previous research paper 
'This building only had two floors 
'Over ten years later the Uni was built over the school

'I tried to correspond
'But nah nothing man

'We are talking total-silence as in
'Newspapers from that entire month
'All gone missing

'She-it-son 
'That archive was a national data-bank

'Only the physical copy I was holding
'So I stole that shit & now its framed
'One day might be worth fat-wads

They were panting hard having crossed three-floors

Ben countered at the steamroll-logic
'I been here all 3 years of school

'If there were multi-basement-levels
'There would be some proof

'A reworked stairwell
'Modified to only move up

'I been on both sides
'Of the main Wells

'Those walls are as old as Miss Finely

Jordan added revrently 
'may-the-cunt-bitch-rest-in-peices

Ben kept speaking
'There would be structural-columns
'With three basements those pillars
'Cant just be erased off the structure

'fk-more-so
'All of our classroom-ceilings
'immigrant-mangled-patchwork
'From the Uni construction
'The Uni had way more money & that job still trash

'You both believe that a stairwell could just disappear
'These stairwells were created by god on the 8th-day for fks-sake
_

A closet door tucked to the exterior-wall at the far-end in the corner

Todd's sweaty palms slid on the locked knob
A narrow closet was exposed by the small window

'got-it
Jordan knelt in front took off his pack
Retrieved a pouch

The door was open and pack back on Jordan's back
Before the other two could follow the action

Once inside, after the brooms & mops
A corridor was revealed to turn down a very-long-hallway

The narrow corridor followed the exterior wall
_

Single-file in the errie-way of knowing an action would change life forever
Endorphins flowed in bounty of oft-asked-question revealed more than mundane

Ben admitted
'This is the real outer wall

'I always thought it was odd
'There were no small windows
'In any of the rooms in the basement


'The Fire Marshall
'Got the school on fire-code

'Rather than expose this wall
'They built that new northside-stairwell
'Whole week the Firemen escorted people up to the hospital
_

The walls made of the pilgrim-old-brick
Large, thick & dark-purple

The tunnel was bare
It held no purpose
No back doors to any classrooms

Only continued long-passage after long-passage

The end came up abruptly as a blank wall

Ben chirpped
'The architect must have been a comedian

Jordan countered
'Or hide access
'To an entire level in a closet
'Sure-as-shit-stick there was a fake wall to back that closet

'Pilgrims times
'The bay was too huge

'Before all them well-to-do-fk-you-fucks
'Bought up all bayside lands

'Back in the day
'This was a scary place to live
'Everyone with guns & knives

'Pirates raided every year
'Roy Miller Path
'Arcs right with this school at its head
'As far as any raider ever went
'Often to kidnapped kids

'Thats why we have that motto

'Once a Buc
'Always a Fk

Ben thought he knew school history
He only vaguely heard people talk of what Jordan said

Ben noticed on the old bricks
Symbols carved in peculiar diagrams
The sprawl of it was typical of angry graffiti

Todd had been busy searching for the door he now only-remembered

Todd's nails scraped against the wall
Along a fine-line found only after difficulty

Jordan moved him out of the way to work at it with a thin steel bar

Peeled-paint revealed a metal door
2ft above-the-ground 3ft high-and-wide

Jordan turned to them for-real
'She-it
'We get caught back here
'Gonna be us screaming

'Think some rag-hoe
'Next period hearing our screams
'Gonna do the same for us

'Best-recognize

'Might as well go all-in
'Right from the start

'Yall best act smart

Jordan patted his bar on palm confidently

Todd took the bar from Jordan
'Maybe I should hold onto that

Jordan only looked onto his hand
He felt completely betrayed by them 
So swift & sure Todd's action

Jordan raised an eyebrow
Content to let Todd do the rest of the work

They all helped pry the hinges into creaked-submission

Somehow Todd always knew this went down
Now he saw into the black depths

The door had the lock from the inside
It fell down the shaft in distant bangs for a long, long time

Jordan let out
'Pilgrims were paranoid muthrfkrs

Ben looked at Jordan
'Wouldn't you be

Jordan smirked back
'be? 

'Son Im worse
'My locks may bend
'But they never break

Ben didn't know how to place that remark
Unsure if Jordan was full of the shit his slang promised
_

Dark musty air flowed immediately to them & up
Strong-as-a-gulf-breeze
Hot as furnace vent

Something caught Todd's eye
He poked at it with the bar

Elevator-cords hung in the mid hidden by darkness

'If there are 3 lower basements
'Then there are only two floors to explore

An exchange of glances agreed compliance

Jordan looked casual
Ben looked like he would not back down

Todd reached with extended-arm and grasped the cord
'Reach out with both hands
'& Commit

He let himself be drawn into the darkness

He left them with a confident smirk
He was prepared for this

Todd fell to the deep
In an unstoppable rapid-slide

!!! HAILMARYFULLOFGRACE
_

All was dark
Distance only abstract 

Movement only testified by the-burning-of-his-palms
Sweat-sprung as will-fought-for-life

To grasp a frictionless cord as skin yeilded to muscles

Todd ventured his legs out
He managed to stop himself into near splits

'Thank-the-Father
He did morning-prayers today

!!! TODD
The other two screamed frantically down

Todd looked up
The door only a small smudge of silver
In the infinity of dark space


'Im okay
'Im okay

'There is oil on the cords
'I should have expected it

'Gonna take off my shirt
'Use it to hold wrap around my hands for grip

Ben asked automatically
Without idea on how to back up the offer
'Do you need help up

Todd fearless began to climb at a controlled rate
'Its best only one person
'Be on the cord at the same time

'Im gonna try
'To find a door
'To get to one of the floors
'I fell pretty far
'So Im guess'n up

Skin-peel-palms grateful-past-pain
For the cool protection of the shirt
_

Todd didn't notice any doors in the commotion down

The best course would be to climb up slowly
To ensure he could get back up

He would feel for the door with this feet
He spat out iron-tainted saliva
'Old oil

The slide down had cleared off most of the oil
His covered-hands now had clean purchase

Only sounds of his breath & swell of air

The gusts came intense, rising in heat from deep-darkness

Todd felt a gust on his stomach
It was cool & didn't come from below
He stomped out the outline of the door

! TWANG
! TWANG

A beam bore into the darkness

'I think

! I found it

With one hand he felt for a handle
The door was there, he could feel the cold metal

!! POMP
!! POMP

Todd stomped the corner down
He pulled himself higher
Kicking-down until the door gave way

He pulled himself into the dusty grey hallway
At the end of a long corridor

'Im off the cords
'Come down

'Wrap your shirt around your hands
'I will be here to grab you if you need it

Jordan challenged
'Best just stay back
'Something get loose and fall
'Right into your face

Ben & Jordan followed down & swiftly entered

Ben, last, climbed inside scraping his knee
Looking up saw Todd & shrieked back falling-on-his-ass

! FUCK

Todd was covered in dusk-caked dark-blood-mud
Blood not oil had been on the cords

Smears were left where Todd had touched himself
Jordan hadn't taken much notice of it

The silver of the dust seemed to repeat what available light there was
_

This level was an abandoned hospital
All lay as if it had been unexpectedly sealed off

Jordan could easily track with layers

They went forward in a cautious manner of adventure

Electricity still flowed on this floor
Emergency-signs gave enough light for them to move secure

Ben told them
'That shaft went way past the length two floors
'The hospital dumps the body-parts thru it
'But that explanation doesnt make much sense

Jordan continued
'It doesn't make much sense
'To have a hospital as a secret basement

'I expected a mid-evil sex-dungeon
'where-bad-kids-get-krumpus

'This was obviously abandoned
'While in full-service

'Not a single empty chamber

At the end of the first hall
Jordan looked into a room

On the bed was a familiar form

'Hold up

Jordan walked inside the room
Only a bed pan & a flipped-over bed
With a swift fling he threw off the blanket

A long decayed corpse lay there turnt-off the-fallen-bed
Sweet smells stung their noses

The horror was simple
No screams or fear of life

Only a complete confidence
Their life was in danger
_

A loud-clang, shuffle and meaty-wacks where heard
A hoarse voice rose but was immediately silenced

The source was distant

The boys took shelter in the room
A corpse for company

The day had long-since numbed their nostrils

Jordan whispered
'Doesnt make sense
'Water from the tap
'Electricity

Ben
! Snap

He took off his pack, using the blanket as tent
Plugged into power
Plugged into network

Jordan & Todd both third-wheel

Rather look at the corpse
Neither help touch it to make a tent

Its hair over-grown
Its jaw dangled stoopidly

Its hollow eyes held a truth
Mystery to present company

Someone was trapped & beaten in the concealed sub-basement of the school
The authorities would no-doubt do likewise to the trio of boys

The three huddled in a room on an abandoned-level layers from escape

An elevator shaft the only one known exit

Jordan an expert in these situations

Mousecraft
The sure way to go about these things

Patience & long-wait'n
Until absolute vacancy was established

For the entire period they waited
Bells could still be faintly-heard

The silence a time for meditation
Accept this drastic turn of Friday morn

Be ready to decide
Upon actions with dire-consequences
_

Their eyes & senses now accustomed they proceeded

Halls built in the same high-cieling-structure of their school
One large hall circled outside & inner arrays-of-rooms

All told obvious signs this area was not frequented

Jordan guided their search
He tracked the dust to know how long since last-passage

The inside of rooms always at highest-end of the vacancy-spectrum:
  untouched -> long-since -> this-month -> this-week -> today
_

Jordan led them to a path that was taken daily

One head-of-the-path led to a stairwell
They followed the other head towards a large-open-room inner-room

It dropped low into a deep arena
Workstations arrayed the entire space

Industrial-lamps draped over each stone table
Shiny-rungs glinted embedded as obvious restraint ports

Under each table
Various shelves for various instruments

Jordan's heart fainted

'All the tools
'In all these stations
'Down all the rows
'Had-been-used-recently

The only daily path led to a table at center-stage
The only table with its light on

Strapped to the table by a broad-leather-belt
Was a nude-red-headed-girl

So bruised was her face
Impossible to see her freckles

Freckles covered her entire body
Freckled to the point that
Tho bloody, bruised & nude
Freckles the first characteristic noticed
An infinite amount of cherry-colored-dots

She had stich-patch-openings all over her torso
Patches appeared in similar fashion all over her body

Her shut-eyes sprang into maniacal-alertness
Two large yellow-orbs

Three boys, not monsters, stood over her

Jordan was unable to free any strap
'How do we get these loose

Confused past-exasperated

'How
!daFKget
'These god-damn-straps-off

Yelling stupidly at the world but really aimed at the girl
Entirely realizing how idiotically loud he was

She screamed just recently
Now she won't speak to save her ass & theirs

Jewels looked back at him

She opened her mouth to display
A mutilated-stump-of-a-tongue-in-a-wag

The stump was fresh
It had an odd-seal as if it was seared

A small muffled voice came to fullness
'Finally sorry
'I could not speak
'Hardly-breathe
'When she lays like that

'Don't you move like that neanderthal
'I need to get ready to introduce us

'A hundred years will teach you patience bitch

Infantile hands pushed its way out of a tangle of hair
A creature emerged from her shoulder

A shrunken-head
Two baby-arms attached
Under shriveled-ears
_

The trio looked aghast
A monster perched on the girl's shoulder

'Yes this is a shock
'I understand ignorance
The little head said in a small voice

Jewels cast her face-to-the-side-ashamed
Nude & openly disfigured took over her predicament as most-painful

The little head made a-small-exasperated-sound
'How are you such a bitch all the time
'You expect these twirps to keep their shit
'With you crying about yours

'I can find you a new-tongue
'A longer one if you are into-that

'You had much worse
'Now no need to disrespect me

'Miss the Countess
Her hands gestured a bow & the little head tilted

~for-fks-sake
Jordan leant in between the two
! we-gotta-get-the-fk-outta-here

'The bands are one leather belt
'Hurry up
'There is not a second to spare
The head said quietly then paused

'Above our head you can release it
'Come on rodents not a moment to lose 

'Jewels can't speak now
'& I can't read her mind
'But I can sense what she is feeling

'She feels ashamed of me right now
The puppeted-head trailed on

Jordan found the clasp to be odd-shaped
Only after some ingenuity was it released

Only with the help of the metal bar & 6 arms

Jordan's shirt was the least dirty
Jewels wore it as a small dress

Miss had them make a measurement & a cut
To tailor the shirt to mold to her-form

The demeanor of Miss had an instant way to blind the truth
Interacting with her as to-an-adult

Ben's shoes didn't fit Jewels
Only his socks

Miss rapped Ben as he knelt to take of his shoes
The rod extended to a painful twang that resonated in his skull

'We need to hurry
'If they come back soon
'Each one of us will be strapped again
'All the worse for let

Promptly they made exodus out that devilish auditorium

The light had a cruel elderly-tint-of-aged-desperation
Its rays seemed to follow them in a-haunting-fashion as-if-pointing-direction
Vengeful that what themselves had accepted must be fated-true unto-all
_

The elevator cord now clean enough to allow them quick-access back up to the basement

Not till they reached the closet door did they recognize their predicament

Todd smeared all over in blood
Thin-streams ran down his face like bloody-tears
Jordan was shirtless
His odd-shaped-belly buldged-out
All were caked in dust
And finally there was Jewels

Ben admitted despair
'How the fk are we going to get out of school
'They are going to know where we have been immediately

'Put us back down here at all costs

Jordan wailed back
'Fk they will just say
'It was another god-damn-drill

'Shit happens like every couple months

'I have a plan
Todd opened the closet door & walked into the school hall

Dusty
Shirtless
Pantless
Bloody

They broke into the hall cast from horror
Sharply outlined to a monotony-of-normal-scenes
The view more contrast by their outlandish forms

Todd had a pre-planned route of exit

At the end of the hall a teacher stopped her lecture
She opened the door and yelled

!!! MONITOR
!!! MONITOR SECTION 7

!!! 459

The call for any who heard to plaster against hall-windows
A mosh-pit of greedy-kids starved for 1st-hand-account 
Only a limited section for viewing

Marinated in a day dreams from revels of the earlier shit-show

Several girls touted the hideous state of the infamous toliet
Some kid Ben had obliterated

Ben afterwards never found
As if he exploded instead thru his ass
Which became the legend

Tho diappearance was normal
The obvious ignorance of the faculty was rare

Up on lunch-meal-meds now in a riot
Each young-heart feral

The four spectated only by the larger-classmates
Teachers in this way were barred from looking out

Todd led them around the corner to rush up the stairwell

Two large Monitors stood as sentinels
Locked-down-in-protocol at the-main-exit

!!! MONITORS
!!! SECTION 1

!!! 459

Two voices boomed

Todd already turnt leading them across the level to stairwells

There was no time to explain
Only for Todd to choose and the rest to follow
_

Cross the school in this method
All Monitors would be drawn to the wrong location

Their exit was higher-up school-levels
Not at the ground-floor as expected
_

Every window filled
Every door blocked

Curious-children stirred by shouts
Starved-sights of spectation
Charged by an eventful-day

Teachers more scared of the fight-pits
Than to do their duty

This factor allowed the five
To the second-floor unhindered
_

Jordan pulled out his metal-bar
'Now is the reckoning
'Suggest yall wake-up likewise

Ben took the hint
He had a second-purpose for his laptop-computer & cords
All his files were stored on a USB drive

They passed the restroom of the morn
Towards the end of the hall

Todd took out a key from his pocket
He unlocked the window

'Just do what I do
'Go where I go

They climbed out onto a narrow ledge
The sun shone hotly on them
They burned under it with exhaustion

Four-odd-bodies outside on the second-story
The world outside too-busy-with-the-day to notice

The ledge continued to an adjacent roof
They crossed over to a high-branched tree

The branch overhung onto the roof in an entangled attachment

By that means they climbed down to ground-level
At the back of the school

Onward into alleys towards less-traveled roads

Each of the boys knew how to pass-this-area without-being-seen
They ran tired but now they knew this-stage was their-turf

They knew over what fences led where
Up which buildings to what

Rat-true
Now they could not get caught

Jewels only had a large shirt & Ben's sweaty socks
Ben carried her piggy back the intervals he could

Headed by Jordan, the other two at her side
This kept her mostly covered

Large-city-bustlers continued their way without heed
The four moved as a pack following Jordan's lead
_

They arrived at the edge of Downtown
Outskirts to the industrial-sector

Jordan turned them into an alley
& Thru a hole in a chain-linked-fence
He loosed it then bound it back

They quickly entered thru a locked-window
The edifice as dusty as the sub-basement

They cautiously followed Jordan's movements

Hopping from board-to-board
Their trace with few tracks

Up the stairs to a room

Jordan locked the room with a chain after they entered
He then pushed away a cabinet to reveal another chain-locked door

'This far from anyone
'Gotta be triple-sure
'So as to sleep

'Breakin thru one of these
'Loud enough to wake whatever sleep

An outside window exposed the endless ocean
Dust free & ocean breeze

Jordan led them thru the outside window
To a fire-escape covered by patched-tarps

The floor was of netted-metal

'Got a tank of rain water
Jordan pointed up

'Open the spout
'& Close it with this knob

Jordan motioned them to turn around

'Aint clear-water
'But cleaner than you

He took a brisk wash in water heated-by-the-sun
The water splashed far below

While waiting for Todd to finish
Ben asked Jordan
'So what is this place

He laid on the stitched-cardboard-mat 

Jordan looked-down as his face blushed
'This is one of the places I live
_

Refreshed & completely exhausted

All laid on layers of cardboard-stitched japanese-tatami

Ocean gusts massaged their tense skin
All slept passed-out-till-next-morn

In safe slumbers
Soothed by the-sound-of-steady-waves
_

They all woke in the daze of a new life
Jordan fed them dried fruit & granola
Washed down with Mtn-Dew

'Got locations like this
'City wide

'I can go any where
'And find myself alright in an hour

'Tho this one is the nicest
'Each has a stash of all I need

Jordan closed the container & stashed the food-box in the closet

'Last week I was stuck across town
'The food there must have went bad
'I was so exhausted I cant remember eating

Jordan finished looking apologetically at Ben
All that now mostly forgotten by the day

Ben realized his predicament with this father
His father would be ready with a self-righteous beating

It was Saturday-morn

From Friday-morn to now
The trance finally woken

Jordan had a rummage-of-clothes raided from the downtown charity

Jewels was head-to-toe with garments that mostly fit
She had hiking-sandals with wool stockings
The light-blue summer-dress only-a-little-too-short

That morn her & Miss  tailored the outfit
Repurposed-stockings for her forearms

Jills was very sensitive about her arms

Miss always held a finely-made extendable-umbrella
This would bar anyone from seeing what was quick-to-hide

Jordan now wore a pocketed vest

Ben took an old-leather-jacket
He tied in a roll under his pack

Todd took a set of wool gloves for his hands
They were very raw after his recleaning this morn
_

Jordan trailed their exit
Covering their tracks as they returned to the streets

'Take everything
'I never go to the same place
'In the same week

Ben needed to get to the payphone at the lower-district Circle-K

The day was warming to be hot

The heat relaxed overworked-muscles
Warmed after a prolonged-stiff-sleep

Ben looked at Todd
'We only have enough for one call
'You mind if I use it

Todd complied
'I am the last of our litter
'My parents wouldn't know if I was gone for a week

The pressing pace of life left Jewels & Miss still to be sorted out
They kept silent or to-themselves
_

After 4 rings
Ben tried the oldman next-door

The old voice responded
'Heeh Hello

'Mr. Grinvix this is Ben
There was no response for some time

'I just wanted to call to ask if you see my dad
'Tell him I'm on my way home

There was only silence
'He isn't answer'n the phone

Ben waited awkwardly
Only the sound of heavy breath'n

The old man finally spoke
'Your dad
'is dead boy

'You best get to the authorities
'an have 'em tell ya

The voice was sympathetic but immediately hung up

Ben stood silent leaving the phone to his ear
Flabbergasted from truth-revealed-lie

His dad would always be there

A jackass who tried hard to keep a light heart

To never-again hit him
Nor give him advice-no-other-could

A man regretful of being a father stuck with a son

Man enough to power thru that hardship
That too-often-than-not himself the cause

Ben physically-worked to come-to-grips
Understandings toppled down
Dazed among rubble

The four in silence
Left him space to wail
_

!!! PLUUPP
!!! PLUPPP

A police car had silently snuck up behind the crew
Its lights now bright at their backs

'Alright you juuhhhh

The cop cut short as the pack immediately bolted

He turned & fumbled open the door
Which he preemptively shut

Today was not a mood for the cop
'Im gonna bust diaphrams
'fkn-lil-shit-fks

The officer called into his shoulder-piece
'Broc here
'I got a 281 on that 459
'Update the 459 is now a 499

He reversed with sirens blaring
Empowered that the level 9 meant better dead
Confident he didn't need to look back

His focus-as-predator never dropping target

In that action he was fused into the building Circle-K

An overworked-trucker, backed by near a ton of Coca-Colas
An unstoppable mountain until about 15-feet into the store

Flesh crunched in sharp folds of metal
Soaking Dorito-chips like salsa

Drowning the cop
In a cold-death of Slurpee
_

Todd looked back in relief

That cop coming must have been the result of Ben calling his neighbor

The timing on the cop made sense if dispatched from Downtown-Station

He took them the back way uptown

What was this all about?
Did it have to do with Ben?
Or is this a result of yesterday?

The question caught his throat
Grateful of the many more steps still to take before an answer

Todd led the exhausted group up the hills towards his home 

Ben had not said a word
The group kept silence 

If the death of Ben's dad was related to yesterday
It would soon be known 

That horizon closer with each step & familiar-landmark
Silence prepares the way with comtemplation

The deep sleep of last night swept away traceless 

Now only entreched in labor with no timely solution
Now only the acceptance of pain as the-state-of-being

The five-miles drew two-hours time
Under sun unabated over a cloudless sky

Seagulls squaked 
Enjoyment the uncomfortable position of beings the gulls envied

Tables now turned to the birds favor
What is toilsome for humans a lesiure birds

The world continued careless
Inside cars disconnected from their momentary-coordinates
Distracted by the thought of the destination 

Four souls suffering & unable
To begin to voice the matters-at-hand

Their souls at full-capacity with the present journey

The made their way up hills that loomed over the Downtown bay
Favoring sidewalks with more shade

A once normal world betrayed as an alien-state
To a group so fused in the throes of turmoil
_

Miss broke the silence 
'I am Miss
'We have not formly met

'I already know your names
'No need to introduce again
'Tho it would be polite

The communication took time to digest
After the miles & silence of misery
They just continued dumbly

Miss paitent
'I have been attached by operation  
'To this girl Jewels who was offered
'As sacrifice to Dagon

'To introduce Dagon to the unanointed
'Is an oath-breaking death-sentence

'But I have the favor of the Seer
'So I may do as I please keeping-oathsworn

'Dagon is a cosmic god
'Infathomable & Unsaitable

'Earth is bribed to Dagon 
'As an occult offer'n by those of the
'Esoteric Order of Dagon

'A sacrifice of this world
'& All worlds connected by Quantum-Entanglement
'For the bounty
'Past imaginations which gods bestow

'All Earth will be consumed
'Drained dry as Mars

'Great powers lie in this cult's foundations 
'The blessings of omnipotent-powers-uncalculable 

'Some envision the gift of infinite-life
'Indesuptably to be as god themself

'I am one of those in faith of Dagon
'All is worth in exchange for a god's blessing

'Jewels is the daughter of a wealthy family

'To pay the price of a family to join 
'The prime of their seed must be given 

'Truthful it is an honor not a curse

'I am 400 years old
'But only a year as symbiotic member of this girl

'As payment into the order 
'The past must live as youth

'Don't be fooled 
'I offer much

'I heal her & repair her
'Myself surgeon centries-in-experience

'I guarntee her life till old age & wise counsel

When Miss traveled to other parts of the body she burrowed
A fleshly-lump the size of a small-ball that moved under skin 

The right shoulder is her preferred perch 
She talks there with the baby-arms holding the umbrella
A shell that Miss tucks away into Jewels shoulder

'We worship the bowels of Dagon

'In Jewels was inserted divine-microbials
'This the digestion of the gods

'When I was an old woman we found the asteroid

'Tales of Eastern-Monks who under-tourture
'Guided us to a prophetized mountain-village

'Prophecy built on ancient astrology 
'& Deep-cosmic-mathematics could not compromise 

'Decades after mining to the asteroid
'Lead to unprecedented discoveries

'The asteroid contained mavervelous gifts 

'The Mound-of-Excrement of Dagon 
'Holy-be-it-Enternally

'Sadly only this small mass of me was left
'When the bateria-microbials were adjusted to our needs 

'These microbrial bacteria enhance the host 
'Bacteria sentient of the well-being of the host as life-itself

'Jewels is stronger than all you boys combined
'Microbials refine all ingestion & assimilation 

'I myself was the first generation to live with prepared hosts
'Viceroy Countess Miss of the Prime Circle 

'If that name doesn't get you out of a pinch
'At some future point when your life is on the line
'Then Imma whores-wet-nurse

They kept to the sidewalks with the most shade & least people
The day was hella-hot & the boys burned pink

Gusts would drown out her voice
Perked of interest they walked close together as Miss's voice did not carry

'I would proclaim 
'Jewels owes us much 

'But she is a foolish girl
'Gets youthful emotions 

'Yes Jewels is foolish
'Myself always busy 
'Patch'n up what she self-inflicts

! WACK
Jewels back-handed Miss

Miss mumbled sorrowfully quiet for a time
! PFT

'Well-I-never-in-my-life

After a few blocks
Miss regained her full-compsure

'Tho 
'I am sympathtic 

'To her need to be kept
'From our modular fashions

'The inner-circle ordered her to be pieced
'Into a more sensibly-modified-being

'The operation was for this morn 

'Jewels is held by us as a priestess
'Name annointed Jewels by the Seer 
'Who fated her to rise above the most high

'The freckles on her body
'Make-up a map to constellations

'The coordinates to a universe
'That attracts the best quantum-possibilites in all situations

'The Order will seek her out because she is this map 
'This skin even-as-leather will leads us to that universe 

'Freckled-patterns can not be captured 
'The freckles shift & move
'As if this location is transient
'Some sphere which settles in favorable situations

'A true Eden to rebirth our Quantum Entanglements

'Only by the boon of Dagon
'After this world is consumed 
'Is it possible to fulfill the godsent-command
'To arrive in a Space-Of-Best-Blessings

'Understand this 
'Her future has such consequence
'If her skin was lost to the Order
'It would mean the end of this most-unique possibility

'Powers like currents have drawn Jewels
'First to wealth, then to the Order
'Now away from the Order
'It is my suscpicion that many would rather guard leather
'Than this girl who has such free will

Jewels red hair caught the beams of sun
A royal beauty that no patchwork could mar
The strange girl who even now drew them together
Men would cat-call out to her & women would envy

Miss continued after they crossed the street
'Only one of our Entangeled-Possibilities needs to reach this destination
'Fate the power which will drag all divergencies to realigned perfect trajectory

'To trust in the power of Fate
'Future to have power to change the past

'The sacrifice of all
'As payment for all to attain
'A more perfect existence

'Our order alone
'Decides for all 
'In solemn manners

Commerical zones now faded to residential streets
Schools, graveyards & empty-lots

Miss stayed herself a while 
Jewels needed to regain strength
It was not easy for Miss to talk while Jewels walked 

'The Esoteric Order of Dagon 
'Dates to mankinds earliest history 

'Trends have taken its symbolism to idolitary 
'Fools will be pretensious 

'The Image of Dagon
'Alone necessary 
'To wield unobstructed power 

'Molecules bow to will
'Exerted in presence of that Image

'I myself am a prophetess ordained by the Seer
'The Seer secretly entitled me
'Follow paths by accordance to Jewels

'But the force of the whole-cult 
'Too much to stop

'Someone so imporant must be improved as insurance
'Every day new demands which I alone could not save her

'The thunder of your friend woke us 
'Providence gathered all that morn 
'To rescue us out of an unbreachable-system 

'Knights & heroes pale to the deeds 
'Which you have yesterday fulfilled

'It only at the cost
'Of only half a tongue

Miss proclaimed as if that a blessing
Miss was odd company to have 

The only thing pleasant
On the long stretch to Todd's house

======================================================================

The sun hot in the hour before noon
Lights were on in Todd's house

Todd burst in heart-in-throat
Eyes readjusting to the different-light

The smell of the outside
Inside the house 

The windows were broken
Leaves whipped-up under family-portraits

Forms of countless-cats at once were made out infesting every shadow
Suddenly the felines sprang into a frenzy

A large Calaco immediately charged Todd 
The heft of it large muscles buldging-tense

Todd had two-smarts-on it
A kick & a snatch

Each of his siblings had owned a cat
He pwned these mangey-cunts

10 cats stopped the attack
None of them cared to risk the same demise of their leader

Which act was duplicated repeat & repeat
Calaco a goolike-mash-upon-the-walls

The pulp of it arose any kitty salivate
So exquistely-rare the cuisine

Quelled-up with great fear of the rampage 
Despite all several stopped for a quick-taste

Cats swarmed over something on the maternal bed
Most of the body was chewed up but it was his mother

Todd began vomiting in the habitual direction of the restroom

Huched-face-first-ass-out across the toilet
Past-prime-pickings now only a gluttonous-feed
The mass of his father

Todd cleared out his home
Macabre painted in stern-rigtheousness 

The corpses of his parents foamed out of each mutilated orafice
Grey puss foamed over the lines of each scratch

No cat-claw could pierce Todd's thick wool-gloves
_

Neighbors came out to witness the loathesome scene
Guilty & in fear of the boy they all betrayed

None with courage to venture near
Two basketball-players died so horrendous
The twins on the way home decided to aid the shrieks
Consequence, puss-filled choked-dead in the middle of the street

The police came but did not interfere
_

After the last of the cats
Past tears 
Todd left the house
Bathed in warm guts 

Todd would use his might to bust the belly
Legs-to-legs above his head 

Cats in lunacy avoided the same fate
Busy in actions which often brought them the same 

Gloves a relic 
The thick wool golves perfect for pussy-busting
Raw flesh able to breathe
Yet protected from all-else
_

Cats have 9 lives
But they are their own-worst-enemy

Cats take too long to do anything 
Contemplating calculated actions aun to their demise

10s of bodies litered the rooms 

Jules could not walk fast in sandals
Jordan & Ben decided to give Todd his space

Near 100 disembowled-bodies trailed Todd's direction

Over short distance the cat is quick
Over long distance mankind reigns supreme

Aun to naps the cats put-off-guard 
Awoken too late by the scent of gore dripping off Todd 

Over-fence, thru-yard, along-country-road, over-cemeteries, thru-fields
Until finally rocky bays of ocean 

Rock-to-rock in hops 
Crashing waves below

Cats moved with agility 
But Todd still much faster

Todd climbed up birthed in gore 
Only one entry into a thicket-walled-island

The twist'n narrow-tunnel opened up to a vast expanse 

Antiquated farm-equipment
Animals of a rare variety
Fire-pits with altars 

One solitary hut built large as a warehouse 
Loomed in the center

Tatched roof to sustain hurricane winds
The edifice had a lifted concrete-foundation

A large bonfire-pit in the center of the circular lot 

The cat with the first warning-message only-just-returned
 
As if only to Todd introduced to as Reaper 
He entered the presence of the Witch 
A mess of steaming-mass vengence unsaited

Crafty & full-of-guile is an old witch
The sight of him froze her dead heart

Slow is man to be slain barehanded
_

When the three finally caught up to dunes
The cats would not near the area

All sat outside
In a countless ring

Too-tired from their massive trip to move
The group had to step over all the cats

Todd was off to himself 
All content to a corner 
_

Jewels stomached her way around the witch's hut
Parts of the witch were so-scattered-such she prayed it due-to-hungry cats 

Leatherbound tomes laid upon altars under balconys
Each balcony with a bonfire-pit
Great iron-pikes stood to hook a cauldron
_

The city was out for them
No where to go but where they were

The supply of the Witch enough to last years
Water piped from a resivoir the size of a pond 
It was kept lifted & covered
Fed by passing torrents

Firewood came pentiful off ocean drifts
Three weeks went by with even less words between them

Each kept to their own interests alone
Each front of the plentiful fire-pits
_

Jewels absorbed herself learning the ways of the Witch
Ordained with life's calling

Weeks in the study of the tomes
Prolonged-deduction of the state of each pit

Symbols, parts & bowels, mixtures & brews

Miss created a sheild-like-tome bound by iron
Four-tomes, two-wide two-tall

Leather-pages made from the thin flesh of the abundant dead cats
_

Jordan spent the time in exploration 

The excellent situation of the island
Built from foundation to be off-the-grid
Preserving better utilities than County
Isolated by many other like-islands nearby
Appearing to be as un-traversable with thickets as the others

A worn rock cliff dropped off to mellow-deep-ocean-waters 
One leap would exfoliate ones skin in deep-cleanse

Sea life was plentiful & transient
Jordan now satifisfied his ultimate-desire
Self-sustenance upon fresh meat killed by his own hand
_

Ben & Todd in similar circumstance
Understood each other as entirely divergent based upon their reactions

A global power now aimed to get them at whatever cost
Sent cat-assassins of wiccan conjury
Ben's dad murdered in an unknown way

The price they had paid for their decisions were heavy
_

The song of every bay 
Existence ever in seasons
Day after day
Today is only
Just another day

Todd & Ben both well-healed in time
In the careful-ways of slow-healing

Ben powered his laptop to the solar-power-station

Todd kept day-long meditations, prayer, & exercise

Jordan lived in peace as if finally repaid from turbid years 

Jewels shielded with an enshrined Tome

Miss ever diligent to guide & grow Jewels talents into abilities

Driscol now permenantly-closed
All students transferred to different schools

The five learned these facts back in town
A month had passed since school was closed

5 girls had gone missing after all the chaos
One girl was rumored to have shit in the same restroom
The smell so terrible the janitors refused to clean it

The other girls were all over the age of menstration

An outbreak at the hospital cost the lives of dozens of patients

Police could only evacuate patients to other facilities
Due to the pure-madness of the chaos

Rumors of monsters & fish-people

The past month had been chaos on the city
Under worldwide spotlight 

Most everyone kept consistent in the news
They split up on different sides of the street for fear the city was on the look-out
No story ever brought up that there were four teens wanted
_

Jewels & the cats kept to each other fondly
Cats avoided Todd at eyesight

Reveering Todd with gifts only as he slept

Dead rats, fish, crabs
& Plenty of money & chains

Todd took to a massive religious-piece
All made in gold large-enough-to-wield
The heft of it a precious-relic

Feline robbers stashed funds daily
In payment for fresh fish Jordan caught & Jewels prepared
All after the manner of the Witch

Jewels learnt all their names
& Kept a ledger for their transactions
_

The lengthy-trip to the city took half a day

The store was a feast paid for by the cats 
They stuffed their packs with supplies 

Sacks of food were tied to their packs
chocolate twinkies bread peanut-butter cheeses dried-meats pasta
_

Baytowns pull in lost-loiters world-wide

Each soul on drift with the tide
Drawn to far-away spheres

The library sat on the hill 
Homeless hobos just below

The Library kept an overgrown field to the back 
The lot left alone as a wild thicket

No-homeless succeeded in making any part of the thicket habitable 
Vegetation a fresh-density even fire would fail to conquer

Unknown to the city the lot had open-access to the city water
A river of water from a pipe flowed thru it & continued to the town

Fuel in limitless supply & limited-area 
The location was dense & impassible
_

At the turn around a corner-side-tree
The five entered the shadows of the lot

Jordan lifted a bush-arm that revealed a small path 
He stopped to turn & look at them
Jordan's characteristic move that meant something serious

'I really feel sorry for you
'Trust me
'I do

'But keep the bitching down
'There are hobos all around

Crawling, packs-first thru a maze 
The trail looked to be made by a rabbit

The walls were too narrow for an adult
Most movements snagged in unseeable ways

Relentlessness if tried true rewarded a scathed-body 
To open paths of civilty

After 45min they reached the end of the snake-like-way

Sidewalk neat as a tunnel ran under a netted-canopy-roof 
Aun light could not penetrate the canopy

The pathway walled by lamp-posts that were lit
It lead to a shed at the end
_

All bled

Jordan said to their bewilderment
'I put those thorns in myself

!!! WHAT

'Alright-fk-off

'I was much 
'Much bloodier
'Each scaring day
'Than you are now

'That took me 
'All winter & five jackets

'But look what we got to ourselves
'A fkn-fortress 

!daymn
'Love being forced to make that path
'A way too terrible for anyone else
'But the person who knows the end

No one was in the mood to buy into-that-reasoning
_

Dim-lights lit the completely-enclosed concrete-path 
Miss admired-always for her cheery-perspectives

'Above look 
'The foundation of this canopy

Miss pointed her shaft up at a metal line

'These heavy cords
'Attached to the posts

'All for that darned Carnival-DesMondes

'If there weren't such 
'Death to the tale I'd call it a-hoot-ta-boot

'Arrogant-migrant-workers disrespected the tropical-storm
'City warned them 
'tsk-tsk

'Only-just set-up-just-drunk 
'When the storm struck that night 

'Torments built into a Hurricane 

'From different-lands is different-fish 
'As we say

'The hurricane rearraged this area but these cords held strong 
'They are the foundation for this thick canopy

'The only thing left of DesMondes
'No worker nor machinery left afterwards
_

The path led to a utility shed 
Power & water & network

'Fort Thickets
An intricatly-carved-log branded the lot

Miss continued
'This place forgotten the years that followed Huricane Karma
'I remember having walked by it 
'How the years hide their gems

'Two-years after Karma
'Only Univeristy Hospital kept open 

'That is why University Hospital has unparalleled off-the-grid-independence
'It is the host of the entire-regions-network

Ben jolted
'The entire region 
'Networked to the same place
That is why all his route-tracers returned bogus-information

Jordan explained
Bringing the focus back
'My grandpa worked here 

'On a research-project on our ancestors
'There were several fotos of my grampa

'Taken a different parts of this place 
'Several for all the Fairs
'At the time there was grass up to the street

'I spoke to a librarian about the place

Jordan pointed to a framed paper on the wall
'Ganked that piece at the Library

The old schematic was the original building plan for the utility shed
_

All took comfort in the utilities
There was a makeshift shower built for privacy a hose & a drain
Welcome after the rural lifestyle of the island

Yet missing the comfort of fire
All together in the only room

Cabin Fever a bite of polar difference

Jordan rationed the supplies 
The others complied understanding
So hard now the passage of life
No longer able to gorge to full-belly
All only ever consumed in moderation

Jordan last to sit
Decided now tell his story 

'One night past-midnight
'Stuck on this side of town

'Crackhead-muthrfkrs 
'Everywhere tween here & Industrial

'Cold-front storm hit unexpected
'Rain soaked everywhere without four walls

'The security guard saw me 
'Loitering and maybe crying 

'He called me inside
'Let me stay until his shift ended at 6am

'I ate half of his lunch 
'I was so cold I drank an entire pot of coffee
'Never could stomach the taste before

'Man I wanted to bathe in the sink so bad
'But that would have freaked-out the guy

Jordan looked to the others
In confirmation the action was non-conventional 

'Coffee kept me in good-spirits 
'Snuck out with that building-plan

'I used pure force 
'Couldn't stop the pursuit until I arrived
'Literally

'The rain didn't breach the canopy 
'As long as I tunneled I was dry & warm

'Rabbits kept the path distinguishable
'Much easier to get thru back-then

'I had to brute-force some parts
'Hell quarter-mile crawling
'Switch-backs & shit 

'I knew the shed would still be there 
'If only four-posts & a ceiling

'But as you can see it kept good-condition 
'I did some trimming but the pathway 
'Kept neat naturally
_

The four rested on japanese-tatami-cardbord

Electricity filled their time 
Carefree life begs obsession

Ben took a trip with Jules to return with the computer
This place more stable for electronics
Code now everpresent on the network

Now understanding the occult fundamentals of how the regions network was established
Overtime he was able to find the patterns in the gateways of packet-traffic 

The direct link to network allowed him to forge packet addresses
A large amount of traffic passed thru the Library as bridge to the inner-city
_

Ben used his network skills to secure them deals-around-town 
rides, chores, grocery

When they needed odd necessities 
Ben would find various people to do them

He would pay them with maps-to-cash 
The delievery would throw the loot in an opening of the vegitation
Thorns were especially thick as a barrier as to only be accesible from the trail

Ben collected many names with reputation
These he manuevered to get what he needed

This first deal consisted of transistors, pop-tars, Mtn-Dew ...
The guy offered to throw in an 1/8 of shrooms & marijuana

Ben mistook the slang & accepted 
The well-tipped-delivery planted the stash gratefuly in the paper bag

After the drop-off Ben sent in him the location of the payment
'$100 taped in the bottom of a bench

Reputation first & big payments where necessary to garner trust
After the initialization, the process went clockwork-smooth
_

Jordan oathed them all to wait for an hour in the bush before entering
One of various imutable oathsworn protocols

Ben had been grabbing data from the archives at the library 
He stored them onto drives he implanted in computers across the city

With the cat's money he accumulated a mainframe in the shed
It constantly whirred in activity

The whir greeted him as he opened the shed door arms-full-of-supplies

Jordan immediately popped up surprised 
'Who ordered the weed

'Jewels will like those
Miss said overlooking Jewels rummage 
Rod perusing thru the items

Jewels recently irate that she didn't have a new tongue
Miss replied tartly
'Tongues don't just grow-for-the-pickings
'Where am I to get a suitable source & workstation

Cats everywhere except around Todd
They had their own, quicker paths

Jules would exchange with the cats 
Pimping new cats nightly
Eact arriving with an offer

A mixture of perfume 
Cakes to fill them with energy
For sex, strength or intelligence
Or just skull-fkd-delight

The once decimated-ranks rapidly grew & grew
The Witch had focused on communication for controlling the cats with orders
Jewels expanded on it with ways to express mutual interaction
_

Blood is thick with identity
Composition stirred by emotion

Blood magic draws strength from those wells 
They drank the brew of shrooms & blood-dreched-mint leaves

Mixture worked together by Jewels into a pact of blood
Bound together in rites

Naturally they sat in a circle
Accustomed to the fires of the island

Trance-State-Jewels formed an intricate DIAGRAM
The symbol encompassed each individual as part of the whole

'May the blood split
'For affinity to the other
'Bind us five more tightly

Each as corners
Arms the connection between
Legs to stablise as anchors 
Eyes each into the other 

The vapor off the aroma
Weed inhaled as incense

The hot brew in their stomachs digested slowly

Cauldron laid center-circle boiled over Jordan's stove 

Hours-upons-hours
Moon till noon
 
Their movements all-surfing-on-the-same-wave
In-tune at different positions of the swell

All looked at the other in reknewed understanding
Familiar whispers assured strengthened bonds 

Hands together bound by a rope
Jewels voicelessly passed them thru the struggles discomfort

Miss recited
'Comfort a sacifice
'We care for each other
'This pain binds us tight
'We reap true bounty only together

After the hours of fasting 
Cleansed-via-vomit

They took their always-packed-packs & left Downtown

Instead of the left turn towards the Dunes
Jewels lead towards her old school Uptown

Miss began her story
Sure of Jewels purpose

'At this school the Duties
'Are old-dike-identical-twins

'I am sure you have heard of them

'Boot-stomping-bruisers
'Bristly as an english-boar

'So loud their march
'Impossible to take them seriously
'Assigned to troll at Ray High 

'After decades passed the women were finally put to the test
'An abductor, of no small size, attempted an idea that would end his life 

'The jarhead beaten to death in a half-hour-struggle

Ben interrupted
'Yeah I've seen that
'Faces of Death covers the last-leathal-10-min-of-the-brawl

Miss hooted 
'After that everyone knew not to fuck with the Twins
'The Hollywood film still tops charts

'Old age has its toll
'3:30 - 3:45
'Neither can keep their eyes open
'The lure of that sweet rest into blissful wakefulness

'If you see two woman coming at you
'Jewels begs you to drop the bikes & run
 
'We have five minutes lets go

! WHAT

'We came here to steal bikes
'I didn't have time to explain
'But a warning is all you need

'Pick one fast & quiet or get face-stomped

They dove in the lot 
Snuck under the booth 
On-que slept the two

Every action was worrisome for them 
Jewels stitched & unseeming passager

City authorities already on the alert to get them
This venture had to pull off smooth
Stressed persperation bloomed from their palms

Lot of bikes were open for choosing  
Unchained due to confidence in the Duties
Whom knew the owner of each bike

big small large brite pimp
A selection unparalleled by any shop

Several bikes at front at gold-painted rack grouped together
All other bikes allowed respectful space

Jules went immediately & lifted the foremost-bike on her off shoulder 
She held the pedal with her hand

Miss chripped
'We are ready hurry hurry rats

Her bike was a tricked-to-shit bmx bike 

Todd took a practical road-bike after a measurement-mount
Looked sturdy after a decade of use

Ben hoisted up a rugged mountain-bike
The puffy tires had a relentless attitude

Jordan was sweating under his load

! are you shitting 
The four whispered in unison
The pimped out bike was ostentacious

Here wasn't the place to debate
They swiftly headed out

Following Jewel's hand motions
Silent directions to keep the bikes from making noise

Unobstructed back out on the streets within 5 minutes

After the corner turn they shouted & hooted
High-speed down-hill
Top-speed

Blasting out onto the coastline
The four bikes bullied lanes

Jordan on a lowrider bike 
All set in chrome
Lights-pimped-with-gadgets 

His kicked-back-position drew his left lip in coolness
His pack bound to top of the rear tire

By the time they came off the high from the brew they were bayside 
Front bonfire under night-sky at the Dunes

They could only piece back the earlier events
Greatful of the plunder 
Busy taking notes on the insights given to them by the shrooms 

Todd noted all their dealings in a record which he kept without fail 
_

Jewels never kept from work 
Wrote down the brew she made Miss memorize
She dried the fresh herbs brought in

Able to act free alone on island
All attention to the moment

Each lost & gained much worth longlasting-contemplation 
Lonely states allow the soul to be susceptible to higher states of being
Re-enforced by need to rebuild the rubble of demolished states of being

They all stared at Todd's replication of the DIAGRAM Jewels had drawn
She replicated it on a virgin part of the dunes at South-Moon

The DIAGRAM was singular in fashion & make
Magnetic bonds pulled them tangibly to sit in their placements

The sand would shift without breeze to form acute angles

Miss began
'This was contact of other beings
'Attracted to us via quantum-entanglement

'All are connected by quantum-bonds to kindred spirits
'Which inhabits spheres impossibly-far from here

'The bond is a constant proof of the infinity 
'Distance is of null impact when in quantum-state

'The bonds drawn in sleep
'Experiencing lives of others as Passangers

'Dagon

'His echo from AEons       
'His might truth

'Nations seek to call him forth as a gateway to divine gifts
'Tho all their world stripped upon his arrival

'The distance that seperates the cosmos is unfathomable

'Quantum properties testify 
'All realities that can pass will pass

'When one acts it creates possibility-nexi
'The more divergent the possibility the stronger

'One creates universes
'& Reworks destiny thru action

'Possibility-Severance occurs when two-liknesses diverge to irrevocable-paths
'Cases have been made for two sects: Chaos & Order

'The distance tween cosmos is unbreachable 
'Aun for the Holy Dagon

'Each life has the power infinitely stronger to breach the barrier of distance
'To contact the other thru human spirit consortium that makes up our bonds

'All hearts to power the other in a robust network
'That act together but physically alone

'This power when grouped by massive actions
'To entangle a being so greatly that the presence must be
'More powerful than Magnet, Gravity, or Love
'Can open the portal to allow Dagon God thru
'Pulling him as Schrodinger's Cat

'Thru ancient traditions passed down by the ages
'Evidence found on ancient-asteroids

'We reknewn tonight
'The Artes of Occult Cosmos Projection

'A rite learned & perfected to directly communicate across realities
'Experience to be shared across universes 

'This DIAGRAM given to us is the public gate 
'Our private understanding & connection with the symbols 
'That is the key to authenticate the intention 

'If we are lured by dangerous hands
'Symbols will betray the trap 
'These you seen form clearly

'Each is their own-worst-enemy
'Each in an Order of Ourself
'For Chaos or Order 

'These symbols associated daily 
'With their emotional attachment

'Symbols tattoed on flesh
'Took upon when the emotion hits
'This gives the power when the symbol writ

'A symbol will reveal Chaos or Order

'The Five of us strong together
'Each as corner for other

'Our rite will be our position we assumed during the shroom-brew
'We will bind our hands & sleep 

'By purchase of comfort
'We attain a way to project to other realities
'Casting our mututal connection there that others may unite

'Able to learn on a scale of infinity 
'Which will all confirm singularity in a situation

Position tho uncomfortable laid-natural
As if only a nudge dropped them down full-swing

All woke each in a different quantum reality

All the world under a dome of earth 

Illuminesent-roots dangled dripping light from the roof 
The plants glowed in shining marvels layered the ground
Each uniquely-florescent in liquid mathematical-patterns

A boy swinging a giant sword which passed thru all uncontested
Plants burst a cool slushy tastfulness of sticky goo
Todd sure it an intoxicant

Each bite was gorgeous 
None allowed any sense of fulfillment

The movement was hurried but anchored in a pace of endurance  
A steady of subborness that carried a hopeless-heart
Defeated yet unable to change course

He stopped to make hand-signs & speak
'My dog

'I need to find my dog
'Voice is passed to you

In any dream prior Todd could never distinguish himself
Now there was a clear-headed distinction of two presence

The boy stopped to make a impatient-questioning-gesture
Jordan came to mind

'Dogs
'Dogs logically gravitate 
'Towards high corners in a dome
'Like the one ahead of this gorge

Todd spoke but the words were Jordan's

'Echoes will seem to originate from each large-corner 
'The corners will draw the dog naturally 
'Each path you make will leave a trace 

'Your hack-n-slash tunnel will be easily distinguishable to the dog
'Your scent is carried in all this goo that drips off you

'The more corners you check
'The more opportunites for the dog
'To come across & catch your scent

Unexpected to a sudden bloom of hope
Joy burst in the boy from the epiphany

As a laugh in a quiet-room
Todd severed from the spurt 

Todd lurched up-ward still-cuffed

000000 BEN    00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Darkness 
Darkness but a candle

He was turnt towards black-walls of glass
Partitioned by of different colors of ASCII text scrolling down 

Hands worked fast over many keyboards 

Keyboards laid all over on the massive workbenchs facing the wall
candles memorabilia wax research-papers code books 

Lurching around in rolls
The man would wheel him-self about
Automatic-habitual-paths

clickity clack clak 

Colorful code displayed on various terminals
Each reviewed over & over

Ben could follow and understand some logic
Tho alien-syntax machine interaction only 1s & 0s

Characters would pour down the wall as waterfall  
Each to fill him with satisfaction never-so-deep

The man would scan then immediately push-on to the next station  
Searching for anomolies or only for the satisfaction of work done

Ben digested the code & commented passively
The man gave no immediate signs of listening
But at times a slight pause of typing to adjust to Ben's ideas

'Give me guidance 
'I have gone
'As far as I can 

The man grabbed a well-used box-vaporizor tube on the bench
Ben recongized the smell of marijuana

With a swift habitual movements his hands made signs

Thumb connected to last two-fingers
Second & Third up hard

sun-pose => fall => inhale-smoke-rise => hand-sign => lower-exhale

The man took a razor 
He cut out a symbol in the wood of the workbench

His got off the chair to step backxx i panorama
Went to the printer to grab a blank sheet of paper

What looked like artwork was revealed a diagram

Ben's eye jerked open 
Darkened by Todd's-shadow-siting-up

The fire longsince-burnt-out 
Ben was cold under a bright moon

Work 
Every second dragged

New customer
Same complaint

New room 
Same mop

In & out 
Dreary-life

Forced to system with no escape

Pentance
Guilty of poverty
child-of-the-state

~Believe in yourself
~You can survive alone

~Take heart & leave this all behind
~Your older brother can go to hell
~For stealin your last paycheck

Jewels was radiant
Under sunrays that sparkled off her light-amber-hair

Her eyes emeralds
Her tongue wet 

The bike hopped 
Rail-to-wall-to-flip

Sparks trailed her as she grinded on a bench

The person shouted partly aroused 
There a deep well of sexual desire

He looked down a roadbike-cleats 
Clicking metalically back to the bike

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

All awoke together but all felt the exit natural 

Time was null
Dimension past traditional lines of perception

'This symbol here 
Ben redrew the polygon sign the man etched in the work-bench

'I want that tattooed across my knuckles

Jewels poked with a sunbleached fish-bone
Steadied-by-her-lack-of-empathy-for-pain

Dipped in root of an herb & ink of octopus 
Peppers & other mixtures to accenuate the fine lines

The symbol beautifully portrayed upon Ben's left-fist
Augmented by the artistic-mastery of Miss 

A simple-but-intricate masterpiece
The black-symbols turned to light-brown-red under the sun

The project became an ordeal which never stopped
Symbols & Shapes expounded from knuckles up the arm
Amplified in patterns of certain-dreams
_

Friday night 
Sabbath of longsufferring-adventures

Night prior fumed rites of sativa induced sleep 
Dunes Friday dawns before a closing-bonfire

The nights were warm
Felines in hundreds lay on them
One moved off to be replaced by another

Blanket of warm-fluffs
Connected the five 
In a web of heat

Wakeful dawn tides set calm-stages 
Passive scenes for their pre-planned actions 

For Todd that first meant warm-up then exercise
Training & habitualizing his body in Oriental Techniques

Dr. Yang-Jwing-Ming had taught him the fundamentals & forms
These forms he would practice then move on to shadow-boxing

The others were always very helpful to spar against
Each had their own style of agression
Jewels was a clever brute force all-in push
Jordan only ever defensive, while Ben grappled

Ironic as that time in the girls the day they met was the only ever win
Ben now had mastered the counter to Todd's technique with a greater vice

Two hours left his body exhausted by his mind awakened
His prayers were coupled with yoga poses

Prayers were contemplation, mantras, readings, writing
Western praktice of sacrifice harded his core with repitition & resilence

Philosohy & sciences oriented his decisions always to gravitate to a larger reason
Most decisions in life have no bearing as to selfish abstractions good, evil or neutral
Best to ensure a loss as a sacrifice, suffering laid at altar of a conception
_

Adventure returned them always to the city
Flock migrations in tune with the season

Spot to spot to spot
All knew the destination
If seperated they all would meet at the next spot

Each had a pack of their core items
Each location had accumulated stashes
_

Miss kept on Jewels to grown her own plants

Power of plant-magik
Unlocked thru engeries of service given to the plant
Sexual-pain in orgasm of the pluck
Never to cut them only guide them with cords

Soil wasn't plentiful at the Dunes
Nor was the enviornment kind to plants
Gusts kept all vegitation stunted 
Salt dehydrated all into a harded bark

Massive acres of Texas farmland surround the city
Miss was sure there would be a region to sneak a garden
A hidden cultivation of plants with access to irrigation
The harvest moon waned its orange tint
Forgotten & unused acres would be obvious as cultivated lands were weeks past harvest
_

Jewels had nurtured month-old-plants
Each nested on the bikes

Tonight was long ride to the outskirts
15 kilometers only to arrive at the border

These plants would find home or die
The roots could not sustain a return journey

Jordan welded a hitch for a one-wheel-trailer 
The pimped-position kept his feet outstresched ahead
Riding low against minimal air-resistance

Agitation on the plants unavoidabley to scar them with a sense of insecurity
Roots would grip peaceful-plains with a steadfastness from the experience 
_

Across town & down roads past horizons
Each truck passing honked
Calling them out as strangers noticed & remebered

Holligans up to no good
The plants probably drugs
Rolling together as pack 
_

Hours passed into moonlight

Jewels finally stopped arms skyward outstreched
Sensing the energy of a wishful-place

Miss affirmed with air-of-pride
'Yes 
'Deep-water in the air

'Jewels your ability is second-to-none
'You dear gem

Jordan keen to practical-ingenuities

Bikes were stashed inside an overgrown-roadside-drainage
Jordan always covered them with a dark tarp
He locked the set with his handy-chain

'The bikes will leave too obvious trail
'Without the bikes, if we move careful
'Passerbys won't distinguish the foot-path
_

Jewels carried her pepper-plant

The strand her variation based on the Witch's main-root
But it was heavily grafted with modifications

Peppers kept off parasites
Peppers helped keep meat
Leaves produced thick-smoke

10 Acres they walked single-file
All infested with dark-red-ticks
 
Mosquitos & gnats feasted 
Bugs bit at their salty-sweaty-bodies in a frenzy

A small hill loomed in the horizon 
Leakage off the hill made the path difficult

Mud caked their shoes till ankles
Shins sliced by serrated-plants

Jordan pointed at rusted-hinges of the gated hill shut for decades 
Overgrown the gate could only be hurdled

Signs of long-abadonment
An old camp chair next to a rusted-thru-tin-bin 
Decades-old-crushed-beer-cans crunched everywhere

Strewn about were odds-that-spoke-of-a-person who kept this place as private-quarters 

Miss commented still worn from the journey
'It must have been a miserable-fool 
'To keep this parcel-of-hell a lounge

Jordan said assured of the hill 
'This is definitely manmade

Tho molds of the hill that had longsince-become-organic
'The plains-dirt causes this shit-pit
'No cohesion to let the water run smooth

They twisted & curved, blazing a path up

Plants thick & greedy for space
Full of things that crawl & bite
Foliage 10-feet-high at places

The path broke to grassy knoll at its summit 
Plateau larger than what-looked-possible-from-below

A dark plane circle lay flush with the ground 

Miss had a habit of annoying them with her poetry
'A dark portal  
'Sacred pillar

'Reflection without ripples 
'Harvest-moon bore mirrored

Each soaked the sweat & tourtures of raw flesh
Little fish nibbled away the crusts of skin & ticks

Miss explained 
'The Downtown Memorial architect
'Once described the difficulty of the process 
'To engineer a water-mirror

~proof of mastery
'Where his words

'Here is one formed by more than happen-stance 
'The reflection adapts stabalizing to perfect reflection

The tamed-grass held a lush Kentucky Green, cool & soft 
Blades of it clung as moistured-gauze
The face of it a balm on tired, bit & sun-baked-flesh

Two hours past in preparation of the banks 
The four turned the soil with whatever was at hand

The removed grass replanted in care
So beautiful the summit vegetation

Jordan went retrieved the still-serviceable barbque-pit 
They alloted a section of the bank for the DIAGRAM constructed with washed-pebbles

Miss conducted rites over metals, wood, mineral
Marijuana was dashed over the top
Each hovered over the flames chanting after Miss

Plants first incensed to calm their nerves
Planted atop the rite materials as bed to the roots
Set to be untouched for a time

Dawn broke as all positioned at the DIAGRAM
Taken by sleep upon carpet of Kentucky Green

All looked across to other
Each sat legs-crossed settled in a balance past-comfort 

A large wick candle blazed-crackily in the center
Mint perked-attention of the passangers 
The candle cooked a thin-metaled couldron 

The omnious sound wasnt-at-first-heard
It crept upon their awakening concious 
Till it stood before their sense full-frontal

'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh
'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh

The words melded to their minds

Tho try as they might could not
Make out meaning to the chants

All were sync'd of mouth

Jewels eyes burst-widely-open
Looking up the the clouds
Where the five lingered

! the arrival

'3 long years we
'Chanted for thee

'Many have come & gone
'But only of you we seek

'I am the Grand Prophet
Jewels spoke in a firm beauty
Adorned by all-fine-things

Her red-hair more gold
As is a new sunset

A tiara laid in fine
Jewels & workmanship 
fish-bones, pearls & worked-gold

'My kin we have exchanged our voice
'To set out in call to draw you together

'My voice is true & worth their sacrifice
'A monks-life not wanted by any

'As sacrifice to bless infinite-realms
'We beseeched thee 
'Aid in meeting

Suddenly the world became whirled as brew
All turned-together 
In the meld they could only make out

'Thru your reality to infect all 
'Earth's existence will be null

The world righted in a drastic move
Pulled back for a micro-instant

The five face-front Jewels
'Prepare
_

All woke slowly entranced by chant

Dryness-of-mouth 
Eyes welled by deep-tears-of-agony

Each across the other
Sore of crossed-legs

They drug themselves heavily to the banks of of the resivour
Not for hours did they speak

Jewels too put-out to set out a healing-vapor

All of them put-out & passed-out on-and-off

Unable to sleep deep the pain ever-present-misery
_

Miss still slept out-cold
The instant Jewels woke 
Miss collapsed of exhaustion

Jewel still bore a hard-amount of dried-caked-blood in her throat 

The trance had lasted two days & nights

Summoned with powerful bridged connections

Prophet Jewels dealt them great harm 
To wretch them so wickedly in suffers-unparallel

Prepare
A message that cost agony

Themselves they found
Were ones greatest enemy

Miss creaked out
'Dagon will be summoned
'but what force can stop
'a gateway built by
'thousands of years

'great minds of the world failed
'but pent-up power so great
'the order can only succeed

With no food they were forced
To make the laborsome-journey
To Jordan's nearest location

The next-winter-months spent at the Library

Winter a bitter-time of sunless-days under a moist frozen canopy 
Passive to the paths of constant-northern-gusts 

! FK-this-damn-stub
Jewels communicated by unmistakable gestures

Jewels was arguing with Miss
Miss would often rap Jewels on the head

All were getting cabin fever

Jordan spoke up
To the other four crammed in that hot but stuffy room

'Lets go back to the Dunes
'Rather have a few bad days
'Then to have all shitty ones

'For-fks-sake
'We all know the others bowel schedule

'Jewels shits first thing
'Todd always at 8:25
'Ben shits after lunch
'I shit before I sleep

Ben snapped back annoyed
'I cant just pick up & leave
'Code takes time to set up
'Before I can think of walking away

'We might not be able to come back
'For a month or more likely

Todd asked
'We been here over a month

Ben got up from the computer
'Dude I tell you all the same things always
'I am refining mechanics

'But to refine the mechanics in code
'You got to take it apart

'Let me rebuild them then lets go

Ben had gotten back down to begin typing

'Wanted: 1/8 shrooms & lb whole-bean-coffee
click clack
'There I sent it
'Nonstop is how we roll

Ben threw an accusative finger at the tatami-mats

'Jordan built those for streching
'Yall need to be busy doing that
_

Computer mainframe heated the studio flat
Five monitors mounted on the wall

The boxes were mounted on the cieling
He would control them via his laptop

He had 10 mounted of varring shapes

Jewels got the shrooms & coffee mixture
Caffine is obnoxiously powerful but the brew would meld it into the high

For six hours straight Miss convinced them to meditate & breath in the brew
It was cooking over Jewels makeshift cooking candle

Miss instructed
'just a tttthhhh
'no hauking please

They streched each other & kept bound to the circle
Six hours no pee or anything

With hardly any regime the short time nearly welcome
Allowing an external-force complete responsibility

Ben had be set to prepare himself
Work 6 hours straight with none giving up

Pain-Leaders
They suffered greatly for the benefit of one mission
One suffering the time in pursuit of the mission 

Mechanics of code are finnicky & specific
Interfaces must have structural-soundess to their logic

The nodes were networked together by homogeneous unix kernels
Each would tap into the network on some task

The cables would have to be dug-up for this access-point to be discovered
Until then he would have untraceable access to a quarter of the city access to the net

Send out data as from fake sources
Send out data as files, messages or listings

Currently Ben had a East-North region of the city accessible by the network
His undernet was already popular from posting about it on all his channels

Ben had discovered network packets don't get analyzed until they get to central
He simply forged all his packed to be coming from the central address

People depended on this network for business transactions
They would devote boxes to represent them on the undernet

This code had to work well before he implemented it to replace running code on all the nodes
_

Miss had be correct
This brew was potent

Ben took a backseat past weary
Another with access to the physical medium which is memory stored in the brain
Able to parse in novel ways that excelled in sophistication

Brain morphed by these new ways of association
Association always simpler & natural

To view code as bonds that can build intelligence
Code as if you were creating true life
_

The plants grew strong under care deepened by the empathy of a mourn
Soon amassed a great-greenery at the top-of-the-knoll

The trip was taken twice a month
To tend to whatever the ecosystem needed

The pond soil rich & warm to company
They errected a sand-bag-wall-barrier
That hemmed the greenery in security
_

All felt a calling near 

They would get a message soon
Today invited the experience 

0 united 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

They woke at the chanting pond from-before

Jewels aged-silver
At the pond chanting

The others each could only-feel the others-presense

In the same over-view overlooking the Prophet
She lead the weary chants

The same tune  
Only the words now audible

'Dagon the dragon
'Is coming thru you

A message natural
Their corporal bodies in-tune
Said-&-heard-thousands-of-times

Jewels burst emerald-orbs-up-at-to-them
The voice cracked in a way unaccustomed to many words

'You will lose your battle against Dagon
'But you will live to kill Dagon's Image

'Each reality Dagon links an Image 
'If killed in one reality
'Dagon's state is transferred to the Image in a previous realm
'Infinity upon infinity

'If Dagon's previous-state-link destroyed 
'And 
'Dagon killed in the next realm passed into

'The chain would fail 

'Dagon's reincarnation obstructed
'The effect is only theortical 
'Only if to reset to an Image past your reality

'A definite victory
'Dagon's link to our realitys
'Again returned to an impassable distance

'Lot fated to fail 
'Learn to survive  
'We will teach you
'The path of impossible-vengence
_

They burst forward
Laid in circle

They recovered in their tent tarp
All preset for the call

Chili-tea brewed with herbal-leaves
Able to sustain them quickly to normal-state
_

Symbols
A major part of their life

They would off-handedly-doodle DIAGRAMS

Stitched onto clothes
Flags to awaken a sleepy-passangers
With the alertness of remembrance
Symbol as anchor to keep their interaction in memory
_

Ben charged at the others
'This reality the gateway
'For a gateway 
'Between distance
'Quantum scale
'Definitely a thing
'A diety would exploit

'The Order has been around past centuries
'There is no 

~Rally the boys
~Off to war

'Dagon is coming
'Thru our cult-shit-reality

'The only logical move
'Would be an all-in
'To accomplish a task

'Cut the head
'Off of the snake

Todd stepped in
'We are fated to lose

He turned to the others
'Jordan will lead us off to someplace
'We will migrate with Jordan as lead
'To various places & in that way
'Be able to fulfill our rites

Jordan spoke up
'Imma side wit Ben
'Hear-up

'Caz some bitch-version-of-Jewels
'Tells us our fate we allow destruction

Todd looked back at them sold
'Cut out the head
'Break-the-system

Todd put out his hand

Jordan linked in
'Rambo rampage & shit

Ben put on his leather
'fk-the-world

Jules flipped-the-bird

Before bonefire 
In fast from want of food

Jordan lead them
'Our reality will be destroyed
'Who but us will be capable to forsee it

'We were told to survive
'What we are to do is get attempt ground-zero

'It will be the least tried possibilty
'Ground-zero can be the-eye-of-the-hurricane 
'Or it could be nuke-city

'That plan allows us
'Then to attempt 
'To destroy the Beast
'From the inside

'All-ever passed-in-this-existence 
'Consumed as meal for one-being-alone
'fk that shit right there

'Cut the murthrfkn-head
'Off
'That murthrfkn-snake

'Why go thru years of chanting
'To give out a hopeless warning

'That bitch believes in us
'& We all believe in her

Jordan looked up with a face
Reserved before a long rant
'The nest of the hive
'Always centers a queen 

'Ice the bitch
'Revenge something

'We know the old school 
'We been there three-years
'Who over us best to break-in

'Besides it'd be something
'I been planned to do
'Since that first morn 

'Xena baby 
'In my arms soon

All somehow creepily knew 
-that- 
About Jordan 

The stuffed-giant-panda 
He loved-to-hump 
Left in his locker
_

Ben kept his network up 
His nodes only connected 
To local networks to siphon off data

The system of the University Hospitaled 
Had one key to backdoor all the data
All services used this same key

If enough traffic was sniffed 
A pattern had to emerge

That password would the backdoor-to-control-all-the-machines 
In this region

Computer Intelligence 
Life-long pursuit for Ben
 
Ben said to the group 
'Todd you never asked me 
'Why I was chased that day

All chewed roasted-pepperoni 
Gront of a bonfire in break-fast-feast

'I got access to all terminals at the entire school
'My dad flip-ta-bich-&-slappped-me-good 
'For that hack session 

'My dad came out to get me 
'To call me on the lie that
'I had detention till 10pm

'I didn't leave the lab 
'Where I planted the bots
'Till after 8pm
'I'd catch the last bus home & say I had to piss

'Cept for my dad had come out all concerned looking for me at an empty school
'Expecting to arrive as Knight in shine'n shit
'By the third-hour in front of the busstop he was pretty-welled-up

'Bots every-day 3am-5am
'All calculated 
'The region key 

'I got impatient 
'After a month I got desperate

'They kept us locked-down
'At the fkd-up school

'One-source of output
'Was a printer 
'Setup in the back of the janitors-closet
'The closet 
'Across from the Moniotor lounge 

'I counted & waited
'All returned after their trolls

'I was in the middle of the hall
'When that bitch-teach screamed

'Those goons caught me
'Right before that corner

'If that code is cracked
'Which it should be 
'Running for months now

'Going to that school
'I agree to be our most important task

'With that key
'All traffic would be plain-text to me

Ben patted at Jordan's arm
'Maybe we sell ourselves too short
'Who else in the fk'n city 
'Could get access like that

'Get the data
'Plant an encrypted-bridge

Jordan gave him a coy-cock-back
'Well if its so simple 
'Why hasn't anyone else done it 

Ben responded 
'I never said it was simple

Insomnia was the soil
Of Ben's childhood

Night was the time 
Dad popped-caps

If Ben didn't stay
Actively moving spots

Pops always managed to find him 
No matter how drunk he was

Popped-a-skull worse the-longer-it-took

So a decision to run 
Was a crossed-line 

Pops ranting about
The cost of those new school shoes

The ones kicked aside-disrespectfully
He would daily inevitably-trip over

He coulda ate McDonalds 
Not that shit-which for lunch
He would prepare on the way out

Ben easily avoided that clumsy-lunatic 
His dad's favorite state-of-being

Ben used the time to read
He built lights in various places
_

'If you didn't mark it
'There was no point 
'Have'n to remember it
'Der dipshit

His dad would lecture him
With the alertness of a hurt
Some sensitive point

'If there wasn't no point 
'Of have'n to remember it

'Then why the fuck 
'Would you read it boy

Ben looked up to his dad 
Despite his weaknesses as a father

Man cracked to the core
Stuck as single-parent-dad 
To provide all in a hard world

His dad would steal textbooks 
From the city library
To learn Ben up on subtle-arts

Ben would wait in the car 
Always on rainy days

'Need a reason to stay hood'd up son
'Two coats to steal-large

Gleaming as a proud man does 
When passing down a lesson-for-the-ages
Endorphins-high rewarded from evolution

Presenting two large textbooks of random sort
Displayed like he had just caught the starving-family food

Dad always taking Ben as ingrate
Guilty that he didn't care enough
About his son to consider which to steal

'Listen shithead 
'When you get the balls 
'That drop and the skills like mine

'Only then 
'Do you deserve 
'Which kind of fruit-of-the-tree
'You be able to eat

Ben's dad was a muthrfkr

The type to fk around with you
Then leave a virgin stuck with a babe for 2 yr

But with gathered courage to come back to raise him single-handed
A fact that Ben would always use 
As pillar to keep the image of his father holy

Most the while
Kicked around in day-to-day bullshit

Ben eventually took up the tricks of his dad 
That skill hoarded him old unix-books like hot-cakes

Black-screen 
Command-line-terminals

For those who want to stay close to the kernel

All computers
Same enviornment on all computers
Unix-cloner on a small-silver-usb

Dad gave it on his birthday
Presented always as payment
For listening to his stories

'Shit you never know
'When shit gets real

'Cops be busting in
'We heard you 
~oink ~oink

'They search evidence

'& Where is the USB
'Full of all the evidence?

'4 Inches out of the puter
'Down your throat
'Before any saw you

'All incriminating-evidence 
'In your shit

His dad
fox-down-to-earth
_

Each year Pops needed less 
& Less alcohol

His dad began to regret 
Teaching the skill to steal

'Learnt is fine & well 
He would slurr
With a slap that would
Make teachers only just want to ask questions

'But boy tell-you-me 
'no MAn would choose 

'that bull-onie-bull-shit
'for some-real-life-skills

Piss on the book
Cutting on a book with a weapon

Laugh'n maniacally

'----like that fkn cop'
'----like your bitch ma'
'----like ....'
_

'lets see anyone else 
'Takeover a whole region's traffic
'fknmuthrfkr

Ben said accidentally 
Interrupting the silence
Before meal in a time of fast

Food cool'n to cold in front
Busy in meditation 
Of some stationary task

Hours of silence
Snowballs in linked-power

Stronger & stronger
Each passing second 

All united deep in trace

Ben on a laptop
Jewels would knit 

Todd would write down histories 
Jordan would keep the fire & cook
_

Ben's outburst dragged all
Back into the current situation

Starvation-bonds are exploited 
By the effect of pseudo-starvation

Hunger among smells-of-food will quick-trigger 
A state of pseudo-starvation
To trick the mind to get that food at all-costs

The state of starvation
Allows the host to be more receptive
Aun hear the voice of an Active Passanger

All would eat the cold food
In deep gratitude

Five pillars
Miss the center
####################################################
# REMOVE
All would be destroyed
First their reality
Dagon would portal onwards
In Quantum consumption 
Reality after reality
Till all possibility scarce
But the Image of Dagon

The Image some type of state
That Dagon can fill as a vessel upon death

Proving the portal can be crossed

If the link strong enough to pass a god
Surely be capable for us four

'We will use Quantum portal against it

Their perpetual states of deterination
Allowed them full imersion of their practice
Food at hand & Time to spare

It was difficult at times
When to attribute a work
To yourself
Or as product 
Of a silent-passanger

Ben as Jordan
Kept it real his entire life

Day to him
A finite time
Which to complete a project

Quantum realities 
Benefit all as one
& One as all

Each action feeds into many-experiences 
Impulse understood as active-passanger

This heavy thought passed 
Them two days fast as a call for all for aid
In pleas for energies & inspirations 
To be sent out for their purpose

They seemed as students
To masterful-hands 
Ghostly teachers
Lessons only in whispers
_

All agreed with Ben
To destroy a god is a rare chance

To succeed would then 
Elevate themselves as gods

Only gods can destroy gods

Todd since a child 
Devoted himself to edification

Meditation, supplication & fasts
These tools of his craft 

Magnified his ability
To dream state

With a prescense above any other

He led lead them thru questions
That filled holes of understanding

'We will never know 
'A thing about anything

'As animal the world around
'Too grand for any to grasp 

'Points-of-perspective
'Blind our eyes

'I commit to codes
'Codes only modified 
'After any act itself

'I agree with Miss
'Quantum reactions lead to new doors
'Each moment can be made easily
'If made towards defined goals

'If my life till death
'Be towards the downfall of this cult

Possibly too inpired
By the mystic brew-de-la-divinacion


'The answers life gives us
'Understood in perspectives

'Jerk'n-off, playing-tag, school

'All sacrified
'For one pursuit alone

'Mathematics & Kungfu

'Defining kinetic logic
'To build stable forms

'All morn towards kungfu
'Wake me into algebraic-groups 

Kungfu was a natural enviornment
For the smoothness of beaches

Sand bore record of weight-placement
The dance to a set of unique-responses

If one in front
One to the back
Then this an option
_

Mathematical Theory
Worked out in notepads

These examples worked 
Over & over often only in pursuit
Of the reason why they were asked
Reasons long-lost of any similarity

Each had their enourmous space on the bay
But in time Ben discovered Todd's recreations

Ben said
'I have Dr. Yang Jwing Ming's compilation
'My dad stole them all 

'I also have alot of mathbooks
'Dad stole those for their size

Ben continued
'They are at a storage-locker
'We could haul the lot with our bikes

Jordan washed in
He circled the bay
Sense'n the mood
Of the monlolithic ocean

Jumping up to join-in
'Hella-doe-boys
'Book no-one uses
'slang-dat-shit 

'For some mad points
'With the Library 

//dad stole to create a library to name after himself 
//return books were ironically preserved so common the theft

Jewels was notified
They mounted up by dusk

Rock-hopping with the bikes uncalled-for
Jordan built a stash under Dunes

** ** ** (stop)

Jewels flashed them down
In her code

Miss' voice couldn't carry past the bike

They turned to see
3 Trucks charging from behind

Out this late
Several choices of roads

Jordan hooted in a small call
'shit-gonna-git-real
'THEY TURNED AROUND & ARE SPEEDING BACK

He led them in a burst of resolute energy
Rolled up to the gate opened the door for the others to continue without delay

Getting off the bikes to pass them over fences
Till they got back out the other side

Houses abandoned since Karma
All in a row to the left
Rolled up to the gates & thru the fence

Jewels tome-busted the back-fences wide-enough for them to get thru
She always carried it to save the day
_

The rednecks weren't fucking-around
A flash of black dove
From the air, into & thru
The backyard in a woosh-of-disaster

Truck jumping on supped-springs
Only a few new-dents of countless
Front a heavily-fortified hull

Truck drifted-to-a-J
Over wet-dense-foliage of the overgrown yard.

!!! HONK 
!!! HONK HONK HONK

Dirt & Plants blasted over the collapsed fence

'Them there it is

'DATS!
'Billy's Bike!

! GIT EM

'My late-wife
'Gave that do my grand-daughter

'You gonna pay!

A hardy-bearded-oldman screeched
Stumbling-out drunk or dazed-stoopid-from-the-crash

This allowing the krew of them to pass out & thru

Two-other-trucks distinctly-heard
Grumbles of the enviornment
In groan-of-the-rowdy-passage
_

The four easily deduced their surroundings-situation
They hauled ass onto the street back on their bikes

Movement as flock 
Jewels in the the lead 

They at times fell to much pain
Unable to keep up with Jewel's jukes

They curved in circle 
Second-to-last-house 

It kept a sound-structure after decades of decay

No-front-door allowed them quick-entry
Swift headlights passing just later

Todd whispered
!up-the-stairs

The stairs held but the passing felt-soggy

The trucks below in a mad charge
Overestimating the speed of a bike

From their dominant position
Only needing to be sure
_

They made look-outs thru windows
To keep tabs on the three headlights

Eventually the trucks pulled around

A voice shouted
'Jim you keep dat circling boy
'We gonna handle all here

'Peep 'em
'Run-em-down-dead
'As christ on the cross

Others hooted


'Got my shotty

! pump-yer-ass-wit-salt
!!! ooooohhhhhwwwwwweeee 
!!! YIP

Five shadows moved as a group
From one house to the next

At first having a great time
In the bashing-deep-inspection

One by one naught even time against them
Necessary at such levels of intoxication

By the umpteenth house
The hunt began to bore

A hard & disgusting labor
To search abadoned houses

Vomit-inducing sights 
That met them unexpected

But they gone too far

! you-wit-me
! bobby-go-wit-earl

'We got this 
'You check up
'I'll check down

Moments later a crash & bash down the stairs 

! fuckaroo
'damn-fuck-cock-biter-stair

'jimmny-crickets-whore-of-a-mother


! BOBBY 
! EARL

! git-yer-ass-here
! help-me
! dumbass-dipshit-hurt-himself

Four others helped carry
The wounded to a truck
They put him in the bed

! HEY YOUS
! FUCK FUCKROOS

! DIS HERE TRUCK
! CALL HER


!!! RUMBLE
!!! RUMBLE 
!!! RUMBLE

!!! DOOOMM
!!! HAMMMERRRR

Loud-screech lost itself in the maniacal throttle
Bass of the truck bellow'n heavy-metal window-shattering vibrations

Two on the sides of the truck
Let down a window-shield

The truck had a logo

'Bobbys Best
'WRECK & CLEANUP

'ole-mother-fucker
'is paid to clear this shit
'how-fucking-funny-is-that-boy

The four heard terrified
A shrill accusative voice

! THiEVry

Justified truck took out first the corners of the house
With its face

The others were linked up to a chain 
Drive a way a for a cave in

! I-aINTA-WURKED-DiS-HaPPy-SINCE-VEGAS

One worker shouted glove on the right hand
A fith-of-something-cheap in his left hand
Leather-utility-belt hung a laborer-hammer

Pace & efficiency alarming the group

'fuckohfuck
Jordan trapped in despair
'Gotta keep it real

Todd pointed back to the lookout
'The guy that other truck is wounded 

'Imma sneak up behind & take him down

'I'll reverse 
'You throw the bikes in the bed

Jordan offered
'I'll back you up

Todd declined
'I move better alone
'Just be ready

His failure would need to become a distraction
But he believed in himself

Hand-to-hand combat was the only real solution
Any loud noise or extra-moment to honk would doom him

Other truck made any escape impossible
Unless in worst case scenario 

Todd would have to get that trucks attention
_

Out the kitchen window & along the front
He schemed his waypoints in a bush 

Kungfu shoes always in his pack
In a hasty loop the backside

Crouching under the rear-cab window
Eat step careful 
Gravel was everywhere

If the driver-door was locked 
He would get in the bed

In a solid-thrust he pulled the handle down 

These drunk ass rednecks
Wouldn't have locked the door

The handle gave then held-firm

'what

!whatdafuck 

Todd used the handle to swing himeself into the back bed

The truck lurched off
Todd now on a bull-of-a-ride
Thrown hard here-&-there

Guy so busy with manual-transmission
With one unusable foot
He was talented

The speed increasing & he was drunk
Todd a bug at this back

Rednecks always have something
Laying in the back sufficent to break a window

Todd grabbed down at metal-rod as he lauched his-shoulder-into-the-bed

In the long pause of a jump
Todd obliterated the back window 

Over-swung-rod continued to a red-line across the-head

! yyyyeaaaaoooohhhhhh

Driver experienced enough 
To not kill them with a slam to the breaks

Still a dramatic-slow tossed Todd inside 
Todd's hips hit the driver bashing his skull to the window
 
'ArGGRreh

He grunted stoopidly as they plowed still into a bush

The other truck still busy gathering-the-men

Todd about to give the oldman a good one before the latter thought smart
His old body had enough and he leaped off in the manner that has kept his hide alive

Todd took the truck hard twice
To even the oldmans crackle heard in a stall

!fuckingmanualmotherfucker
!gddamnu
!gears

The defeated passager only mumbled in a pile to himself

Todd gave out an unnatural curse
His hands worked into a handsign

Then a passanger took over
Right leg & hand moving independent
To a screeched reverse

Then the passanger passed
Todd kept on till the house

He slowed & pathed them of path towards a yard
Stopped & reversed in the movement he learned

The driver booted out for the chasing truck
To have to stop to pick up

Todd kept the chasing truck away from the other truck
Which had too-late-learned of the change of events

Todd's body screamed in pain of his previous ride

The truck-of-rednecks took the long way to meet up
Honking the attention of the truck that scouted

Their truck now carried to many to go fast safely
_

Ben had overestimated the amount of books his dad stole
An infinite amout of trips wouldn't move them all

Jewels busy massaging Todd's wounds with a balm
Pepper-balm-stung-hot-in-a-scrub
Mint-oil-balm cleaned areas-of-distress

They had no where to park the truck
So the bed was loaded till bound-buldging with a tarp

Jordan had them park it as the Library
They would make the dreary next hour crawl
_

'aye
! tack ! tack ! tack

Reluctant guard
Got up to the iwndow

!outtahere
!libraryclosed

Jordan yelled back
! truck in parking lot has hundreds of fucking books

The guard did't believe him
Jordan wouldn't leave on his own accord

'Dude
'Im fucking serious
'Just look over there at that truck

Guard unbought
'Yeah & what you want in return?
'All we got is books no money

Jordan called back
'I dont want anything

Gaurd now woken completely up
'Fine lets go kid

'fk with me & Ill be sure you are banned

Guard irritated turned his head
Entered the lot to see the books

'Oh fuck
'That is a shit-ton of books

Walking on dark streets briskly
Working something mechanical in his hands


After quick-glanes 
He wraped a bungee-cord around the post

Lasers now scanning the intersection for traffic type 

Passing cars would trigger a recording in a feed-alert
An arm held a banded screen that lit up with the image of the feed

6 of them set up
2 minutes of maximum coverage

A warehouse at the docks sat alone
Waves crashed out in the bay in heavy sprays

He would leap if he had too 
Ocean a good place to ditch puter

Rogue & neglected network scans
Always had this location in common

Location a matter of public inquiry

Weeks to prepare for this night

Cord-rolled & ropes flopped outside a backpack

'find the office
'find the gateway 
'hack the hack the gateway

'Run this cable along the gate
'Set it up to the city-utility-connector

'That green box at the end of the corner lot 

'I am going to upgrade their connection
'But I will use it as a network hub

The man new handsigns
He made them quickly & surely
From habitual movements

'Four of us
'Quite an audience 

'Keep tabs on my wrist
'When it lights up to be sure 
'Nothing is missed

The late hour kept the alerts down

'Probed an oceanside-window last-week
'I'll enter thru that way

'Security checks up a few times a night
'No system to the timing

No-alerts finally came
Two minutes to scale the street-side fence

He only needed 20 seconds
Nike-Free soles molding to the fence
Which he took up & over pack-on at a running-start

Landing-quiety as he dropped over the other side

Fences were his expertise
A preferred hurdle to deter chasers 
Or catch-up someone who underestimated Ben's trained ability

Along the shadows of the fence 
One location to another
That could-hide-someone

Movements direct & pre-planned
He was at the base of the two-story office-building

A loory alerted & passed 

Window-ledge to a jump-hike-up-gets-arm-up 
Then the remeaning 75% of body onto the roof

Each movement partioned to only a certain-amount of body-weight 
If one fail two other anchor 

One of the gems-learned in youth climbing-trees

These quiet-movements needing to be swift in a flow
Ben kept his Quigong (breathing-techniques)  

The next alert flushed with him against the window
Hidden from any point of view

He worked open a rusty window
Only open-enough for his body thru 

As soon as he entered he made a handsign

'Leave the escape-hatch open or closed?

'closed
'open needed in life-threatening-situations where escape paramount

Ben shut the window

Inside smelled of a musty-warehouse
Tho this office-quarters

Family-portraits & anti-stress-toys 
Any disturbence could be serious

His pack was flush with his back
Alaptop & wires were removed

His laptops were disposable
This would allow serval hours in a power-out 
But if a power-out persisted
The machine could only be powered on again physically

The gateway-box was in a locked-closet 
He withdrew a pack

Only after clumsy effort was the door opened
Hum-of-always-on-machines greeted him softly

A bogus label described this laptop as the company DNS server
! Keep on or speeds will slow ! 

He attached on the company-gateway
! Check DNS laptop 
! Is it powered on !

Gateway-box had a sticker which described the network details 
Someone wrote in marker the Internet-Service-Provider-Box

With that information 
There was no need to get into any computers

All configuration files quickly adjusted to fit into the network 

Man-In-The-Middle
Pretends to each it is the other end 

ISP->fake->guy
guy->fake->ISP

`umount /mnt/`

Laptop powered-off & the network cables unplugged
After the laptop booted he only then plugged the cables 
In the following schematic

This box preset with OTOPSKOPIE logins accessible to his undernet

It worked away in the verification process of contacting the isp-gateway

! ping-muthrfkr !
 
A wet-napkin wiped the laptop over 
None of the alerts had been security

Ben woke from the vivid dream & wrote it down

One image called out to him
A photo on a desk he passed in the dream

Family photos on a sandy beach

~Pilgrims Pennesula
An icon of the coastal-shape 

He recognized that part of the coast
It always made him curious 
No road went that way on the Bluff
_

Ben went over to Jordan
Fnding Jordan out snorkling with Todd

He passed them a few oranges 

The tide was nice & calm 

Sky promised it would be good

Jordan answered
'Pilgrim's Pennensula
'Never heard of it

Ben said
'I could make out the shape of it
'It was south of the bluff

Jordan smirked
'Well if it did exist 
'I would know about it


Todd felt a draw towards it
'Why dont we go tonight
'It will be a full moon

Winter cabin-fever 
Took them to deep-fights
Dammed energy compelled them
To long excursions

Ben took up the challenge 
'I bet 4 supply trips
'The place was a landmark-tourist-attraction

Jordan took it
'Logically it would be where they first landed
'It may be different in this existence

'fk-it-tho I never been out there

'fk-i-hope-im-right
_

They hitched a ride most of the way there
Walking their bikes along oceanside-highway

'Yall taking a trip this late
An over-sized truck pulled over eager to make use of the bed
Man at about 50 wearing a decade-old truckers-hat

Jordan replied
'There is a party southside at the bluff
'Ben gots a date
Jordan nudged-openly at Ben


The old man jeered
'Throw the bikes in the back
'Yall can come inside
'Cab big enough

'Fine someone gets laid tonight
'I aint got no possibility

Jordan always kept their packs in front when hitching
A good barrier & first-contact-pad if one had to jump-out

The old man cackled-loudgly the entire time 
Making the best out of company
'Any particular place?

Ben put in
'HEB 
'we need to get a few things

The oldman parked out-front-the-store
'Im just around the corner
'If I see yall again I'll pick ya up

A definte of a goodbye as any

'Can we get you a 6-pack
Jordan asked

The oldman's eyes glinted
'Nah best keep a happy wife

They thanked him & he continued one-wards
_

Fresh supplies always hard-got
Stores were lands of plenty

Jewels managed to sign with hands stuffed with goods
( trip worth )
( good-hitch jordan)

Jordan smiled back
'Yeah that geezer was legit 
'We can scout a base & camp eazy

Ben took the hint
'Alright alright
_

The cashier looked upset by their selection
Obnoxious in the cost & near too-much to carry

Ben asked the downcast clerk 
'My friend said there was a party
'Some place called Pilgrims Pennesnula

The worker started-up 

His long oily hair stuck to him
He turned & looked side-to-side to face them

Bandages behind-his-ears which hid-tatoos
'Kay first never mention that here

He leant in closer
'Tonight at midnight yall
~is-gonna-be-HELLA~
The clerk sang

'Just keep on Jalisco straight after the barrier

Oily neck as if the deep-folds-of-skin leaked
20 seconds later he called loudly

'Its gonna be tits bro
'Your girl gonna be there
'So wassup girl

The worked inspected Jewels figure
Muscular legs in stockings & shorts

Jewels ignored the cat-calls & walked off 
_

'A-holy-fk
'this wind

Jordan grunted as they made their way down Jalisco
The main street of the town

Their bikes kept with them only by force
Now at a straight-shot back to the city

'Fk-YOU-fkn-wind
'FOUR-fkn-4 !

Ben shouted up
'We stash the stuff with the bikes
'At the barrier & go scout on foot 

Jordan turned back
'Sounds-like-a-plan
'Goddamit Jewels stop smiling
'Just caz that guy wants you

'Aint it enough all us want you

Todd chirped in 
They walked a staggard-line
'I wonder 
'What it would have been
'Without that hitch

'Like I mean
'So many random-events
'To create so drastic a possibility

'We now have to share with the next quantum-generation

They were going about half the speed but it was leisurely
Jordan & Jewels forced to walk which they always hated

Soon the sting of sand brought their packs up to proteck their faces

A mile & a half
No buildings were built & the road only continued

No lights nor pavement 

Jordan related
'This bay hit-gold round the 60s
'Karma took it all away forever

Todd interupted 
'The less people 
'The better

Ben argued back 
'I like the hustle of people
'People can make the night
'Like that oldman

There was plenty of places to stash all-but-their-packs 
After the road continued leveled ground 
Thickets splattered here & there

Ground a gray-clay 
It stuck to your feet 

Todd's nikes were at a disadvantage
Streaks of the clay now smeared along his calves

Sand no-longer a blight to them the wind now soothed

Todd spoke to Jordan 

'I can make out the old road
'You can tell because 
'There are no old trees along here

The mellow road made the path easy 
A single-file enjoying still-in-new-energy

Jordan spoke back
'This path must still be necessary
'These tracks here 
'Either rednecks or government 
'To have tracks like that

'That barracade looked impassable 
'Im guessing authorized-traffic

'The town knows something & that oldman did too
'That date in your dream is probably legit
_

Jordan ordered
'Up that hill to the left
'Gonna-be-a-bitch 

'But I don't want to stumble into something 
'That I coulda-seen-coming 

Jordan scouted the length of the side 
Then guided them up the best route

Thickets dense but animals used this location 
Paths easily passed traffic

Car-rotted-to-only-the-frame half-buried into the overgrown hillside
Roots had longsince claimed the metal as its foundation 

Place unused by humans
Only antique-trash that was long-left-forgotten

Miss stopped them with a whistle
(whiirp whiirp)

Jewels knelt her knees 
Onto the grass 
& Sat down her pack

Using clippers & twine 
Jewels made four sands-keep-bloom sachets

(rare)
(good luck)
_

After rest & refreshments they mounted pack

Top was hard to path-thru until it suddenly broke-away to a panorama
Dark shoreline illuminated by great waves of the ocean

They never used lights when they were off their bikes
Lights betrayed your precise-location from great-distance

Conversely ones presence
Is consealed after only a few feet in the dark

Jordan lamented
'Buildings about 50 feet 
'Off that barnacle outcropping

'It all looks run down
'But you can see the straight shadows of the roofs

Todd esteemed
'Ah I see it now

8:37pm Jordan calculated they had about 30 minutes to get there
Traffic from the bluff would cost about 45 minutes

'We got 15 minutes of quick-exploring
'They we need to get back to this spot
'To check on any car-lights headed here

'Engines should alert us well before we need cover
_

~Pilgrim Pene... 
A sign half-buried-in-the-sand

Ben pulled it out
'The exact same
'See the logo

All buildings degraded from decades of mis-keep
All heavily-boarded except for a singular locked-entrances

'To get inside these would require
'Half the building torn down

'Their barriers are well-kept 
'Here like this window
Jordan pointed in front
'Wood is paler than that window above

! Thud

His elbow tested the work 
'soft thud means its on-there-good

'suspicious

Jordan circled the next small building
'No all these
'Sealed good 

! vrooom vroom vrooooooooom
A V8 charged out of the darkness

The light broke the dark air
Them saftely back to the thicket

Deer trails that no truck could follow
Would lead & hide them back up the hill

Bayside in an off-the-map area

No roads led here
All paths upon transient-sands

Five of them at the lookout

! vroooooooom 

Truck experienced to the path
Paving the way for the others to follow

As first-comer it rockets out onto the beach
Keeping clear of the building
It slides sideways to a halt

Multiple dark form leap out of the truck
Jump in frolics to the deep waters
_

An hour later most of the traffic had arrived

Buildings now all operable in service

Feeding booths of live animals
Fortune telling & street-magicians

All light kept to staked torches
They in merriment got wasted an alcohol

A loowry made the path
The trail touted a cannon

It would launch sacrifices
Deep out to sea

Hundreds of people attended
Yet the mass still seemed under it
Tho no one ever left

The buildings of limited size
Vehicles far to the rear
_

A great bonfire was built
Hoot & rite about getting the tower gased & lit

A single-file-joined-by-hand
Coiled around the bonfire

Coil winding over & over
Till more than a thousand

Humans & Aquatic-beings
Worshiped around bonfire
All bound each to other
_

Esoteric Order of Dagon
Robesmen encircled the crowd

It led them in their odd
Aquatic-hums that felt like deep-water

The line uncoiled & returned hand-bound
Back to the deep sea near the out-cropping

Robesman kept around embers 
Men & Women were forced 
In odd-attached-orgy

Tentacles & plump-sacks

All unkoothe

Todd then saw it

The LOCHNAR

It sat as ornamental-necklace
Scales glinted under its green-light

The distance impossible
Yet Todd saw it by reach-away

Set in folded gold & other fine ways
A hermaphadite god enlaid

Miss interrupted Todds deep scorn
'It has met you

'The orb of the Seer

'Only rumor that
'It from any straight-line
'Can attract one directly

Todd admitted
'I saw it
'As if it was in front of me

'It lit up all as micro-moon

Miss coninued
'I am no stranger
'To that glory

'To the bold
'It gives godhood

Miss spoke to the all
'These heathens serve Dagon's aquatic-cult
'A science of returning to the sea

'They have a vicious nature to them
_

Deer paths were plenty in parallel to the road
Rested they made the pleasant way to get their bikes

Worked-over-path helpful rolling along bikes
 
A fox was out smiling with crab-dinner

Hilltop pressed down with small-camp
Sand would get anywhere

So the trick was to let it come & go
Barring it out would only trap sand more

They slept soundly in hammocks

5 Students in a library on the second floor
Overlooking the floor below

Government officals looked at their findings

The classmates had successfully tracked down
Items of legend to world-wide-press

He was too-smart for the officials
In a feint he put the ring in the small box

Immediately after the boxes collected
'You will have no more dealings with these matters
'Any attempt would be a loss of your family-line

Military Police allowed them the arrogance of turning into themself
In relish of the spoils

He was quick out
They were at bottom level

'Hey I saw you
One of the students ran up

'You didn't give yours
'You will get all our families killed

The boy pushed him off & continued 

Vengeful the student yelled
'He took the LOCHNAR
'He took the LOCHNAR


He was out submersed into the streets
LOCHNAR a trusted-friend after months

He recovered several of the rings

The red-gem called to him

It was in possession of several thugs
'Heard you asking about ruby jewlery
One said as the thugs circled his pack

'You got the ruby
He said in an arrogant way

The man flashed up into a rage 
& The two parties fought

LOCHNAR in the end
Subdueing the thugs

Ruby aun jumped away under a desk

In going to retrieve

Out came a little spider

'oh sir oh sir
'we serve we serve

'to you to you
'sacrifice sacrifice

The gray of the hairs in semblance
Of a majestic mane of the little spider

'Eight Legs
'Many eyes
'All yours

He thought a second then agreed compliance
The Ruby would rebuild spider kingdom

Air deep in hot water
Humid air accentuated by farmland saturation

Past midnight but sweat'n

! CAR

Texas flatlands allowd plenty warning of a car at night
They would dive into some hiding aided by the camo attached to their packs

Tome for Jewels, firewood for Jordan, Waterproof tarp of Ben, & the Black Hood of Todd

Grouped together they could easily cover themselves in an open space
Hardly cars out this late of night so deep into the country

A old one-pump-station was midway
It was always visted on the trips

But this time it would be on the way back
In the morn after the night on the hill

They past it all dark & shutdown
The familiar smell of it in the air grumbled Jordan's stomach

Harvest Moon too bright to see headlights
& For the headlights to notice the back

Under cloud too dark to see anything
They traveled low lights lit from the wheels

This contrast would empower Jewels to embue that spirit
Into powerful concoctions dormant until expressed as a feeling

Brew state would give them powerful dreams
Smoke state would inspire them fore journeys
Balm state would calm them to deep meditations
Edible state would purge them before fast

Due to the feminine lure of drugs
5 Were often blitzed in those states
Trading with demons of the abyss
Recieving Innsmouth-esk Trophies

Ideas to actions aun objects
Post state in awe of the reality of such things

Jewels recipies were endless
Each part of her day a different masterpiece cohalenance

Jordan would prepare & stragize 
He would recieve objects like locks

Ben would code on
Reformed to computer understanding

Todd would meditate-kung-fu
Dilligent in some body-hardening-task

This hill allowed them an endless supply of weed
So ya-know they had a heap of it

Drugs & labor interwined by love
_

Jewels prepared a faggot
Weed, flowers, dried herbs, weed, driftwood, weed

After the rage of Jordan's bonfire settled to red coals
They linked together by their leather bracelets

They would loose leather-strings then wrap each-around-the-others
A hold tight but escapable

Jewels set the cone & they all drank her tea
Each facing away from the other

In a circle as when laid down
The head closest to the cone

0 TODD 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Mountain-tops in Asia
He on a trail-run to the ridge

Path of it all difficult & narrow
Moves true always or death near

To be delayed after dusk would be impassable
No place to sit no where near enough to lay

It is for the boldest of heart
To take these two buckets

To supply the villiage of which he was a slave
In thise reality everyone is a slave

This lone mountain spring
Drip by drip by drip to only a small pool

He would fill up the buckets with staff between
This was training to for staff management of maintaining balance despite much

A staff maintained with steel rings to attach the buckets
With such week after week trails

Paid too good to stop
No other bold enough

Every runner has died in a run
This without exception

Yet this movement was his art
Bondage is opressing in life

Out here naught any could touch him
Out here he was king of the world

Todd was amazed by the mastery of complex movements

Hip training warm ups were the vital key
Low to the ground made the path passable

Aun the buckets were used as achor points
Movements as a kung-fu which instructed Todd

Which positions were most powerful where & how
Camel-Kung-Fu 

He made a movement to anchor himself with the steel-rungs
Handsigns were swiftly executed with a dab of precious olive-oil

'Slavery could not stop us
'Here as I am subjucated as all

'Here I am your master
'Tho more blessed you sure to be

'Tai Chi Qi Gong

'Breathe in & keep your center
'Breathe out & move
'Breathe in & keep your center

'This staff gives me 1/8 leverage
'To make a polar double-end into a stable four vector

'Caz it weighs so much

He tightened with one & pulled with the other
With a whip of the back, the steel ignited against a rock

The one proud boulder now chipped away a good chunk
'Here one these runs
'I reign King
'This is a long Journey

Todd was then able to speak
'I am of a tribe
'Five of us live as nomads

'Our city is out for us
'& Well most importantly

'I have to lose to Dagon
Todd felt the lump down his throat
Of one caught instantly yet that acknowledgement never cause imbalance

'Then we have to kill him

Without handsign Todd was put back
'The visions are true then
'Nightmares of the void without possibilities
'All existence as substance to one whole

Todd was learnt enough to produce the feeling of confusion

'The fkn-nightmares
'You are telling me 

'You dont have them?

Todd was placed back in front
'My dreams are always pleasant

After a moment
~ HAH 
'So then Karma is a god
'You live in peace
'& Everyone I know is tormented

'The same dream but at different parts
'As if we are some quantum mechanic
'In a machine that computes outcome

'Well I bless you for what you have to do
'Sin for me to envy so fortunate a soul 
'A unique gift for you

Todd betrayed suspicion in his friend Ben
'Ben
'Beware that name
'Ben is the 
'root of all evil

Shock sent Todd up
First time last of
All of the others
