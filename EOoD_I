###### ESOTERIC ORDER of DAGON

! Clank clak clik
Todd ran his hand down lockers lining empty-halls

15 Minutes past the Bell
Point-of-no-return to class

Any student this late gets writ-up
Ironically worse than not-arriving-to-class-at-all

`Devil has idle hands when works harvest
Todd inspired himself to no avail

His purpose in the basement
Below, front the door he planned to open 

Latency became mounted by endless-anticipation
Energy from day-dreaming now a hurdle
Aun compelled him towards the opposite direction

The thump of Todd's feet steady
Step-after-step up stairs to higher floors

A peace appreciated
In a place only-ever bustling

The few rays of the sun bore thru
Only to expose dust-polluted air
_

Mellow ambience shattered
Patters of running-feet charged towards his direction
From around the corner

Fortune placed Todd directly opposite the girls restroom

Distance leapt in one bound
He rushed to the last stall

Todd let out a cocky smirk
An instictual-ingenuity to hide in the girls

!! KAK

Cracked-seat Todd stood atop broke
Left-foot plunged ankle-deep into hour-old piss & shit

Door quietly opened
Someone made an attempt to open the first stall

A muffled-yell came from the hallway
'BEN WE KNOW YOUR IN THE GIRLS

!! BOOM

Heavy-legs-kicked-open-near-cracked-the-door-in-half

Unexpected fright broke unprecedented-pressure into full-release

!!! BRAPPPPPPPPPPUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSS
!!! PPPPUUUPPPPTTTTTUUUUPPPPP
!!! PPPPPLLLLQQQQQQIIIPPPLLLUUUUKKKKIII

Entire school vibrated
Eruptions of great-masses expounded essays

!!! GAWDDAMN BEN
!!! YOU SHOULDA SAID WHY
!!! YOU NEEDED tHe gah hiRls

A schoolhall-monitor hooted out for-the-entire-building-to-know
Announcement gagged-quiet
Gas particles bloomed-out in a thick cloud
_

Room silent after the door fell shut & resettled
All walls of the building rumbled in giggles

!! PAT
!! PAT
!! PAT

Ben kicked at the stall door braced-shut by legs
'Gonna make your fat-cunt-trap
'Eat that shit you scabby-bitch

Todd stepped out of the stall
'Back off

Ben turned to him more crazed

! YOU

Todd swiftly tackled to the wall
Slamming hard as his soaked-foot slipped-out

Ben muffled as he struggled out his revenge
'You are the reason I got chased

'walk'n around
'like you weren't 
'skipping class

'a teacher notified
'the monitors and got me chased down

Todd maneuvered using Ben's force against him
Set forearms placed Ben in a locked-hold

After several curses & a long pause Ben surrendered
'Alright asshole
'You made your point

Todd pushed Ben off to a safe distance
A toilet flushed and another boy joined the scene in the girls restroom

'Sorry about that
Jordan blushed-out the awkward introduction
'Im sick

He scruffed his unkept thick brown hair into a fluff
His subconcious mechanism to divert attention

Momentarily all content with breathing the compressed-gas in silence
_

Walls washed white layer-after-layer
Extenuated by dark recesses between the tiles
Unable to conceal deep-red marked graffiti symbols

Piss marked all to a feminine territory
If only the stain but mostly the smell

Curiosity here only met horrors
All repelled from investigations

Ben broke the silence
'This place is kinda creepy

Hot-box-gassed-up
No where to go until the class period ended

A sound tickled Todd's ear
An enchanting burr at the tail-ends of the echoes

Before he realized he was interested
Echoes drew him closer to the wall

Todd startled then reaffirmed

'There is a hum
'Sounds like a whimper
'Can you hear it

Jordan put in as he neared
'Probably a god-damned-ghost

He yelled at the trash-can playfully
'School is hella-haunted
'sk-a-dick Bettsy burns-the-dick

'back in the 50s ...
Jordan started his story

Hum came from the metal-box next to the trashcan
Rust smeared as Todd opened the lid for better acoustics
Vent dropped to darkness

Todd spoke into the vent
'We can hear you

( need help help please help )

The sound came softened from great distance
In a fullness-of-scream that rips apart throat-lining

Communication faint
Todd looked to the others for confirmation

( help us    please )

Jordan ventured between Todd & at the vent
'Here
'we are here

'Where are you

( can you hear me  hello please help )

Jordan continued
'We hear you
'We will get the Principal

!!! nnnneeeeeeehhhhhhoooooooooooo

Shriek took all three back in a tight terror
Pitch-to-curl-ear-hairs in absolute revolution

Todd opened the lid with both his hands to shout down

'Who ever you are
'Where ever you are
'We will find you
'That is a promise

Todd left immediately, others followed dazed
To them it seemed a reckless commitment

At 10-min-to-the-bell the hall is at its most empty
Policy prohibits anyone out-in-the-hall

Trio made their way without obstruction
All Monitors back in their lounge on the couch

Todd led them confidently down lower floors

'I discovered a secret passage behind a door
'When I got lost my first-year fire-drill

'All year I been trying to work myself
'Up to this before graduation

'No chance ever came
'So today I promised
'Id make it happen

Todd only-one-he-knew who had seen the long-corridor
Despite years he still believed in what he had seen

'Since first-year
'I been planning how explore it

'Today is too much for coincidence
'A secret door will lead us to her
'I am certain

Todd now empowered by rambunctious company
Three boys followed the stairwells down
A small pack not-to-be-fucked-with

On-the-move breaking all violations
All-in since they left the girls

Todd continued as they rossed lengths of halls of the first year students
'When I got lost

'I felt someone calling out to me by-name
'I followed
'Tho less-than-a-handful knew my name

'I found a door at the end of the hall
'It was unlocked
'At first I only peaked in out of curiosity
'Hard to say no to exploring with a rep like Discrol

Jordan jumped in
'Trust me you dont know most of it
'One story 

Todd annoyed kept on his same train of thought
'But at the back of the closet
'A light-source instead of shadow

Jordan perked in interest
He let Todd continue without offense

'I had time to wander so I entered
'I discovered a long corridor

'The path went ahead for a long time
'It ended at a black hole in a wall

'I am sure it leads down
'But I forced myself to go back
'Before I got near enough to know

'Goddam-creepy-place

Todd looked ahead determined
Pent-up-forces now unleashed propelled him forward unstoppable

Thru the hall towards the basement
Moving around windows
One-at-a-time ninja-like till they got near gym-lockers

Jordan expounded
Stirred with the brisk walk

'Shit-man
'Most my papers for school
'Were all about school history
'Lame-as-fk-mate 

'Yo tho 
'One caught me like

!daymn

'At center-city-library
'People all WTF
'You shoulda been there
'classic

'But the article caught me unexpected
'Bored, but try'n to look like
'I wasn't only there for the roof

'Im thumb'n thru all these papers from the start
'Research'n the first instance Driscol got famous

'This floor is the only basement
'Right so with that-in-mind

'There one article
'blow-your-mind-man

'A boy found pieced-up
'In a fishy cult ritual

'Im like some lil muthrfkr
'Put this pulp in tryna-act-smart

'But !Daymn
'The newspaper solid-legit

'The article said the janitor
'Alerted authorities from across the county
'They almost hung-up on him as nutt-case

'But then they heard him
'Get eaten da-fk alive
'Fleshy sounds & munching
'Huge masses of people chanting

'Man screaming 
'Kept alive past possible

'PoPo from all over the county stormed the place

'That shit all happened 
'according to multiple statements in the newspaper
'On the muthrfkn-second-basement floor

'First I took it considered Uni Hospital first-floor
'But then I remember from a previous research paper 
'This building only had two floors 
'Over ten years later the Uni built over the school

'I tried to correspond
'But nah nothing man

'We are talking total-silence as in
'Newspapers for the entire month
'All gone missing

'She-it-son 
'Archive a national data-bank

'Only the physical copy I was holding
'So I stole that shit & now its framed
'One day might be worth fat-wads
_

Each panting hard after traverseing three-floors
Nervousness strained fibers of the soul

Driscol topped the worlds abduction statistics
Prisions less locked-down than the students of this school

Ben countered at the steamroll-logic
'I been here all 3 years 

'If there were multi-basement-levels
'There would be some proof

'A reworked stairwell
'Modified to only move up

'I been on both sides
'Of the main Wells

'Those walls are as old as Miss Finely

Jordan added revrently 
'may-the-cunt-bitch-rest-in-peices

Ben kept speaking
'Structural-columns
'With three basements those pillars
'Structural-columns
'They can't just be erased off the structure

'fk-more-so
'All second-floor ceilings are mangled-patchwork
'From the Uni construction

Ben accentuated with a pointed finger
'The Uni had way more money & that job still crap

'You both believe that a stairwell could just disappear
'These stairwells created by god on the 8th-day for fks-sake
_

A closet door tucked to the exterior-wall at the far-end 
Past the last classrooms isolated 

Todd approached the door window
All transpired as domino-effect of past choices

Small window exposed a narrow janitor closet
Todd's sweaty palms slid on the locked knob

Light kept on
Exposed a definite century-old-wall to the beack of the closet

Despite countless proofs human-heart only ever ready to doubt
More confirm all else besides what his experience told him
All momentum fell flat on its face as mis-step 

'got-it
Jordan knelt in front and took off his pack
Retrieved a pouch, door open, & pack back on Jordan's back
Before the other two could follow the action

Jordan not dismayed by Todd forelorn-face-of-loss
After two quick-movements back-wall of the closet opened-inwards

Jordan chuckled
'Todd you missed the obvious marks
Jordan pointed ot the round scars on the floor

Narrow-corridor revealed to turn down a very-long-hallway
Corridor followed the exterior wall of the building
Single-file on eerie currents of certain course 
Irreversible alterations defined life
Endorphins flowed in bounty of oft-asked-questions

Ben admitted
'This is the real outer wall

'I always thought it odd
'There no small windows
'In any of the rooms in the basement


'The Fire Marshall
'Got the school on fire-code

'Rather than expose this wall
'They built a new northside-stairwell
'Whole week the Firemen escorted people up to the hospital
_

Walls made of pilgrim-brick
Large, thick & dark-purple

Brickwork technique lost
Pilgrim-bricks most now all sold-off or stolen
A marvel-of-it surrounded them in bare tunnel
No back doors to any classrooms 

Only to continue long-passage after long-passage
_

End came up abruptly as a blank wall

Todd went busily to search for the door from his memory

Ben chirpped
'The architect must have been a comedian

Jordan countered
'Or hide access
'To an entire level in a closet

'Pilgrims times
'The bay too huge to defend

'Before all them well-to-do-fk-you-fucks
'Bought up all bayside lands

'Back pirate times 
'A scary place to live
'Everyone with guns & knives
'Sure-as-shit-sticks 

'Pirates raided every year
'Roy Miller Path
'Arcs right with this school at its head
'As far as any raider ever went
'Often to kidnapped kids

'Thats why we have the motto

'Once a Buc
'Always a Fk

Ben thought he knew school history
He only vaguely heard people talk of what Jordan said

Ben noticed on the old bricks
Symbols carved in peculiar diagrams
Sprawl of it typical of graffiti

Todd busy searching for the door
Against a blank wall
Todd's nails scraped along a fine-line 

Jordan moved him out of the way 
He went at it with a thin steel-bar

Ben jolted
'How do you manage to get it thru entry-clearance

Jordan's eyes lit in a smirk
He put he bar to Ben's face to inspect the lines & numbers

Ben replied only half convinced
'Security really believes you use it as a ruler

Jordan laughed
'Its more believable in its bag next to my pencils & calculators

Peeled-paint revealed a metal door
2ft above-the-ground 3ft high-and-wide

Jordan turned to them for-real
'She-it
'We get caught back here
'Gonna be us screaming

'Think some rag-hoe
'Next period hearing our screams
'Gonna do the same for us

'Best-recognize

'Might as well go all-in
'Right from the start

Jordan patted his bar on palm confidently

Todd took the bar from Jordan
'Maybe I should hold onto it

Jordan only looked at his hands
He felt betrayed by them 
So swift & sure Todd's action

Jordan raised an eyebrow
Content to let Todd do the rest of the work

They all helped pry the hinges into creaked-submission

Somehow Todd always knew this went down
Now he saw into the black depths

The door had the lock from the inside
It fell down the shaft in distant bangs for a long, long time

Jordan let out
'Pilgrims paranoid muthrfkrs

Ben looked at Jordan
'Wouldn't you be

Jordan smirked back
'be? 

'Son Im worse
'My locks may bend
'But they never break

Ben didn't know how to place the remark
Unsure if Jordan full of the shit his slang promised
_

Dark musty air flowed immediately to them & up
Strong-as-a-gulf-breeze
Hot as furnace vent

Something caught Todd's eye
He poked at it with the bar

Elevator-cords hung in the mid hidden by darkness

'If there are 3 basements
'Then there are only two floors to explore

An exchange of glances agreed compliance

Jordan looked casual
Ben would not back down

Todd reached with extended-arm and grasped the cord
'Reach out with both hands
'& Commit

Todd let himself be drawn into the darkness
He left them with a confident smirk
He prepared for this

Todd fell to the deep
In an unstoppable-slide

!!! HAILMARYFULLOFGRACE
_

All dark
Distance only abstract 

Movement only testified by the-burning-of-his-palms
Sweat-sprung as will-fought-for-life

To grasp a frictionless cord as skin yeilded to muscles

Todd ventured his legs out
He managed to stop himself into near splits

'Thank-the-Father
He did morning-prayers today

!!! TODD
Other two screamed frantically down

Todd looked up
Door only a small smudge of silver in the infinity of dark space


'Im okay
'Im okay

'There is oil on the cords
'I should have expected it

'Gonna take off my shirt
'Use it to hold wrap around my hands for grip

Ben asked automatically
Without idea on how to back up the offer
'Do you need help up

Todd fearless began to climb at a controlled rate
'Its best only one person
'Be on the cord at the same time

'Im gonna try
'To find a door
'To get to one of the floors
'I fell pretty far
'So Im guess'n up

Skin-peel-palms grateful-past-pain
For the cool protection of the shirt
_

Todd didn't notice any doors in the commotion down

Best course to climb up slowly
To ensure he could get back up

He felt for the door with this feet
He spat out iron-tainted saliva
'Old oil

The slide down had cleared off most of the oil
His covered-hands now had clean purchase

Only sounds of his labored breath & swell-of-air

Gusts came intense, rising in heat from deep-darkness

Todd felt a gust on his stomach
It cool & didn't come from below
He stomped out the outline of the door

! TWANG
! TWANG

A beam bore into the darkness

'I think

! I found it

One hand felt for a handle
Door the cold of metal 

!! POMP
!! POMP

Todd stomped the corner down
He pulled himself higher
Kicking-down until the door gave way

He pulled himself into the dusty grey hallway
At the end of a long corridor

'Im off the cords
'Come down

'Wrap your shirt around your hands
'I will be here to grab you if you need it

Jordan challenged
'Best just stay back
'Something get loose and fall
'Right into your face

Ben & Jordan followed down & swiftly entered

Ben, last, climbed inside scraping his knee
Looking up saw Todd & shrieked back falling-on-his-ass

! FUCK

Todd covered in dusk-caked dark-blood-mud
Blood not oil had been on the cords

Smears left where Todd had touched himself
Jordan hadn't taken much notice of it

Silver of the dust repeated available light
_

Forward in a cautious manner of adventure
Level an abandoned fully-equipped-hospital 
All lay as if unexpectedly sealed off

Electricity still flowed on this floor
Emergency-signs gave enough light for them to move secure

Jordan spoke in a whisper
'move & stay
'think first

Jordan in front with hand up for them to stop
He crouched down & motioned the other two low

'look at the ground
'any movement is timestamped & each direction obvious

Both caught in admiration of their newfound companion
Jordan broght them to a crossroads of halls next to a room

'look close at each hall & the room
His finger traced out-lines of different levels of dust layers
Careful to keep to his rule to not make extraneous movements

'I cant tell the exact days
'Only the relative difference in traffic 

'this is the main hall
'the path has thinned down 
'compared to the hall there we came from

'compare it to inside the room
'No traffic goes there

'this is how we can know where to go

Inside a room an overturnt bed
A familiar form lay half-sprawled

Ben entered to draw down a corner of dust-layered blanket

A husked-corpse exposed what left of a face
Sweet smells stung their noses

! twang

Ben recoiled back flipping a metalic bedpan
Urine long-since dried-up & fecal matter dust

All froze to the simple horror 
Death the expectation of failure

Ben's face captured shame & apology

! bap
! bap bap

Main hall echoed meaty wacks
Each nearly shit-themselves

! aaaahhrrrrr
! eeekkkaahhggggggggggggg

Distant defiant cry gurggled into silence
Jordan herded them into the room
Each took a corner of the blanket they lifted 
Thick-settled-dust of the blanket flung over their tracks partially-covering the treads from the shaft
_

Boys huddled in the room
Corpse for company
Green of the blanket still stained silver by the dust
Respectfully laid back over the dead-body

Day had long-since numbed their nostrils
Sweet-smell now lost to their senses

After time passed Todd braved a whisper 
'Shaft went past the length of two floors

A question which none could answer

'Uni dumps the body-parts thru it to where?
'That explanation doesnt make much sense

Jordan spoke 
'Not much sense
'To have a hospital as a secret basement

'A-mid-evil sex-dungeon
'where-bad-kids-get-krumpus

'that would ease my sanity

'This obviously abandoned
'While in full-service

Todd whispered
'Doesnt make sense
'Water 
'Electricity

! snap

Ben lurched at the obvious fact he overlooked
He took off his pack & repursposed the blanket as tent

Plugged into power
Plugged into network

Jordan & Todd both third-wheel
Put on edge by Ben's rapid-fire-keystrokes

Risk-of-them-all-weighed-in-&-merited
Curse-the-free-will-of-others

Corpse stared back at them
Hair over-grown long as womans but sex lost to time
Jaw dangled stoopidly
Hollow eyes held a truth
Mystery to present company

Someone was trapped & beaten in the concealed sub-basement of the school
Authorities no-doubt do likewise to the trio of boys

The three boys huddled in a room on an abandoned-level layers from escape
An elevator shaft the only known exit

Jordan an expert in these situations
Mousecraft
Sure ways only to go about these things

Patience & long-waiting
Until absolute vacancy established

Period-bells could still be faintly-heard
They waited for an entire period

Silence a time for meditation
Accept this drastic turn of Friday morn

Ready to decide upon actions with dire-consequences
_

Eyes & senses well-accustomed they proceeded to the main hall

Halls mirrored the  logical-structure of school above
Main hall circled, outside & inner, arrays-of-rooms

All watched for signs of frequented areas 
Fresh-signs of treads not man-made

Jordan led them to a path taken daily

One head-of-the-path led to a stairwell
They followed the other head towards a double-doored-room

Path to the entrance fresh
Todd & Ben hung back as Jordan looked thru a crack
Confirming no movement he motioned the others to follow

Stairs descended into a deep arena
Workstations arrayed each segment of stratus

Industrial-lamps draped over each stone table
Shiny-rungs glinted embedded as obvious restraint ports

Under each table
Various shelves for various instruments

Jordan's heart fainted
'All the tools
'In all these stations
'Down all the rows
'Polished-from-recent-use

Fresh paths led to a table at center-stage
Only table with its light on

A nude-red-headed-girl bound illuminated
Strapped to the table by a broad-leather-belt

So bruised her face
Impossible to see her freckles

Freckles covered her entire body
Freckled to the point 
Tho bloody, bruised & nude
Freckles the first characteristic noticed
Infinite constellations of cherry-colored-dots

Stitch-patch-closures covered her torso 
Patches appeared in similar fashion all over her body

Her shut-eyes sprang into maniacal-alertness
Two large yellow-orbs in fierce fire

Three boys, not monsters, stood over her

Jordan immediately busy but unable to free any strap
'How do we get these loose

After no response yet exhausted of ideas
Confused past-exasperated he spoke to her square-on
'How
!daFKget
'These god-damn-straps-off

Idiotically loud 

Boys behind him idle & timid to horror intertwined with hormones

Girl who screamed earlier
Now won't speak to save her ass & theirs

She opened her mouth in wide-display
A mutilated-stump-of-a-tongue-in-a-wag

Stump freshly seared & gleamed with an odd-gooish-sealant

A small muffled voice came to fullness
'Finally sorry
'I could not speak

'Hardly-breathe
'When she lays like that

The voice became more clear yet kept small

! Jewels
'Dont move like that neanderthal
'I need to get ready to introduce us

'A hundred years will teach you patience bitch
'You think I dont know what you are doing

Infantile hands forced its way out of a tangle of hair
A creature emerged from her shoulder

A shrunken-head
Two baby-arms attached under shriveled-ears
_

Trio aghast
A monster perched on the girl's shoulder

'Yes this is a shock
'I understand ignorance
The little head replied indignant

Jewels cast her face-to-the-side-ashamed
Nude & openly disfigured took over her predicament as most-painful

The little head made a-small-exasperated-sound
'How are you such a bitch all the time
'You expect these twirps to keep their shit
'With you crying about yours

! hhhmmmmp

'I can find you a new-tongue
'A longer one if you are into-that

'You had much worse
'Now no need to disrespect me

'Miss the Countess
Her hands gestured a bow & the little head tilted

~for-fks-sake
Jordan leant in between the two
! we-gotta-get-the-fk-outta-here

'The bands are one leather belt
The creature paused dancing a rod idly in the air
'Hurry up
'There is not a second to spare

'Above our head you can release it
'Come on rodents
'Not a moment to lose 

'Jewels can't speak now
'& I can't read her mind
'But I can sense what she is feeling

'She feels ashamed of me right now
The puppeted-head trailed on

Jordan found the clasp to be odd-shaped
Only after ingenuity the leather-band released
Only with the help of the metal bar & 6 arms

Jordan's shirt the least dirty
Jewels wore it as a small dress

Miss had them make a measurement & a cut
Foremost to tailor the shirt for her-form

Demeanor of Miss had an instant way to blind the truth
Interacting with her as to-an-adult

Ben's shoes didn't fit Jewels only his socks

Miss rapped Ben as he knelt to re-lace the shoes
Rod extended to a painful twang resonated in his skull

'We need to hurry
'If they come back soon
'Each one of us will be strapped again
'All the worse for let

Promptly they made exodus out the devilish auditorium

Lght had a cruel elderly-tint-of-aged-desperation
Rays followed them in a-haunting-fashion as-if-pointing-direction
Vengeful what themselves had accepted must be fated-true unto-all
_

Elevator cord now clean enough to allow them quick-access back up to the basement

Not till they reached the closet door did they recognize their predicament

Todd smeared all over in blood
Thin-streams ran down his face like bloody-tears
Jordan shirtless
His odd-shaped-belly buldged-out
All caked in dust
And finally there Jewels

Ben admitted despair
'How the fk are we going to get out of school
'They are going to know where we have been immediately

'Put us back down here at all costs

Jordan wailed back
'Fk they will just say
'It another god-damn-drill

'Shit happens like every couple months

'I have a plan
Todd opened the closet door & walked into the school hall

Dusty
Shirtless
Pantless
Bloody

They broke into the hall cast from horror
Sharply outlined to a monotony-of-normal-scenes
View more contrast by their outlandish forms

Todd had a pre-planned route of exit

At the end of the hall a teacher stopped her lecture
She opened the door and yelled

!!! MONITOR
!!! MONITOR SECTION 7

!!! 459

Call for any who heard to plaster against hall-windows
A mosh-pit of greedy-kids starved for 1st-hand-account 
Only a limited section for viewing

Marinated in day-dreams from revels of the earlier shit-show

Several girls touted the hideous state of the infamous toliet
Some kid Ben had obliterated 

Main attraction like a relic in a church
Girls recounted their impression always to curious gatherings of students

Up on lunch-meal-meds now in a riot
Each young-heart feral

Four phantasms spectated only by larger-classmates
Teachers in this way barred from executing proper protocol 
_

Todd led them around the corner to rush up the stairwell

Two large Monitors stood as sentinels
Locked-down-in-protocol at the-main-exit

!!! MONITORS
!!! SECTION 1

!!! 459

Two voices boomed

Todd already passed the hall turnt leading them across the level to stairwells
Movement looked like Todd's plan failed to the other four

Yet the aura told a confidence the others relied on whole-heartily 

There no time to explain
Only for Todd to choose and the rest to follow
_

Cross the school in this method
All Monitors drawn to the wrong location

Their exit higher-up school-levels
Not at the ground-floor as expected
_

Every window filled
Every door blocked

Curious-children stirred by shouts
Starved-sights of spectation
Charged by an eventful-day

Teachers more scared of the fight-pits
Than to do their duty

This factor allowed the five
To the second-floor unhindered
_

Jordan pulled out his metal-bar
'Now is the reckoning
'Suggest yall wake-up likewise

Ben had a second-purpose for his laptop-computer & cords
All his files stored on a USB drive

They passed the restroom of the morn
Towards the end of the hall

Todd took out a key from his pocket
He unlocked the window

'Just do what I do
'Go where I go

They climbed out onto a narrow ledge
Sun shone hotly on them
They burned under it with exhaustion

Four-odd-bodies outside on the second-story
World outside too-busy-with-the-day to notice

Ledge continued to an adjacent roof
They crossed over to a high-branched tree

Branch overhung onto the roof in an entangled attachment

By those means they climbed down to ground-level
At the back of the school

Onward into alleys towards less-traveled roads

Each of the boys knew how to pass-this-area without-being-seen
They ran tired but now they knew this-stage their-turf

They knew over what fences led where
Up which buildings to what

Rat-true
Now they could not get caught

Jewels only had a large shirt & Ben's sweaty socks
Ben carried her piggy back the intervals he could

Headed by Jordan, the other two at her side
This kept her mostly covered

Large-city-bustlers continued their way without heed
Four moved as a pack following Jordan's lead
_

They arrived at the edge of Downtown
Outskirts to the industrial-sector

Jordan turned them into an alley
& Thru a hole in a chain-linked-fence he loosed then bound back

They quickly entered thru a locked-window
Edifice as dusty as the sub-basement

They cautiously followed Jordan's movements

Hopping from board-to-board
Their trace with few tracks
Up the stairs to a room

Office building once a newspaper printery
Newspapers stacked in dusty-heaps

Jordan locked the room with a chain after they entered
He then pushed away a cabinet to reveal another chain-locked door

'This far from anyone
'Gotta be triple-sure
'So as to sleep

'Breakin thru one of these
'Loud enough to wake whatever sleep

Room inside dust-free
Cardboard tatmi layered neat

An outside window exposed the endless ocean
Dust free & ocean breeze

Jordan led them thru the outside window
To a fire-escape covered by patched-tarps

Floor of netted-metal
An escape rope coiled to a corner
'Got a tank of rain water
Jordan pointed up

'Open the spout
'& Close it with this knob

Jordan motioned them to turn around

'Aint clear-water
'But cleaner than you

He took a brisk wash in water heated-by-the-sun
Water splashed far below

Jewels & Miss to theirself
Front the window content with the bayside view

Endless ocean to the right
Left held the iconic skyline

Fresh air taken into grateful lungs
Peace long-lost now found in abundance
_

While waiting for Todd to finish
Ben asked Jordan
'So what is this place

He laid on the stitched-cardboard-mat 

Jordan looked-down as his face blushed
'This is one of the places I live
_

Refreshed & completely exhausted

All laid on layers of cardboard-stitched japanese-tatami

Ocean gusts massaged their tense skin
All slept passed-out-till-next-morn

In safe slumbers
Soothed by the-sound-of-steady-waves
_

They all woke in the daze of a new life
Jordan fed them dried fruit & granola
Washed down with Mtn-Dew

'Got locations like this
'City wide

'I can go any where
'And find myself alright in an hour

'Tho this one is the nicest
'Each has a stash of all I need

Jordan closed the container & stashed the food-box in the closet

'Last wee stuck across town
'Food there must have went bad
'So exhausted I cant remember eating

Jordan finished looking apologetically at Ben
All mostly forgotten by the day

!fk

Ben realized his predicament with this father
His father cocked with a self-righteous beating

Saturday-morn
From Friday-morn to now the trance finally woken

Jordan had a rummage-of-clothes raided from the downtown charity

Jewels head-to-toe with garments that mostly fit
She had hiking-sandals with wool stockings
Light-blue summer-dress only-a-little-too-short

Her & Miss  tailored the outfit
Repurposed-stockings for her forearms
Jills very sensitive about her arms

Miss always held a finely-made extendable-umbrella
To bar anyone from seeing what quick-to-hide

Jordan now wore a pocketed vest

Ben took an old-leather-jacket
He tied in a roll under his pack

Todd took a set of wool gloves for his hands
Very raw after his recleaning this morn
_

Jordan trailed their exit
Covering their tracks as they returned to the streets

'Take everything
'I never go to the same place
'In the same week

Ben needed to get to the payphone at the lower-district Circle-K

Day warming to be hot
Heat relaxed overworked-muscles
Warmed after a prolonged-stiff-sleep

Ben looked at Todd
'We only have enough for one call
'You mind if I use it

Todd complied
'I am the last of our litter
'My parents wouldn't know if I was gone for a week

Pressing pace of life left Jewels & Miss to be sorted out
_

After 4 rings
Ben tried the oldman next-door

Old voice responded
'Heeh Hello

'Mr. Grinvix this is Ben
After no-response came

'I just wanted to call to ask if you see my dad
'Tell him I'm on my way home

Still only silence
'He isn't answer'n the phone

Ben waited awkwardly
Only the sound of heavy breathing

Old man finally spoke
'Your dad
'is dead boy

'You best get to the authorities
'an have 'em tell ya

Voice sympathetic but immediately hung up

Ben stood silent leaving phone to his ear
Flabbergasted from truth-revealed-lie

His dad would always be there

A jackass who tried hard to keep a light heart

To never-again hit him
Nor give him advice-no-other-could

A man regretful of being a father stuck with a son

Man enough to power thru the hardship
Too-often-than-not himself the cause

Ben physically-worked to come-to-grips
Understandings toppled down
Dazed among rubble

Gour in silence left Ben space to wail
_

!!! PLUUPP
!!! PLUPPP

A police car had silently snuck up behind the crew
Its lights now bright at their backs

'Alright you juuhhhh

Cop cut short as the pack immediately bolted

He turned & fumbled open the door
Which he preemptively shut

Today not a mood for the cop
'Im gonna bust diaphrams
'fkn-lil-shit-fks

Officer called into his shoulder-piece
'Broc here
'I got a 281 on the Driscol 459
'Update the 459 is now a 499

Cop reversed sirens blaring
Actuator of the law of this land

Empowered by the level 9 code
Perpetrators better dead

Focus-as-predator never dropping target
In that negligence he was fused into the building Circle-K

An overworked-trucker backed by near a ton of Coca-Colas
Impact shifted both forces into the path of the store
An unstoppable mountain till the back wall 

Flesh crunched in sharp folds of metal
Dorito-chips soaked soggy as in salsa

Cop drowned to a cold-death of Mtn-Dew-Slurpee
_

Todd looked back in relief

Police must have been the result of Ben calling his neighbor
Timing on the cop made sense if dispatched from Downtown-Station

He pathed the pack the back way uptown
City knew their identities & placed to ambush them

Questions caught his throat
Grateful of the many more steps still to take before an answer

Todd led the exhausted group up the hills towards his home 

Ben had not said a word
Group kept silence 

If the death of Ben's dad related to yesterday
It would soon be known 

Horizon closer with each step & familiar-landmark
Silence prepares the way with comtemplation

Deep sleep of last night swept away traceless 

Now only entreched in labor with no timely solution
Now only the acceptance of pain as the-state-of-being

Five-miles drew two-hours time
Under sun unabated over a cloudless sky

Seagulls squaked 
Enjoyment of the uncomfortable position of beings the gulls envied

Tables now turned to the birds favor
What is toilsome for humans a lesiure birds

World continued careless
Inside cars disconnected from momentary-coordinates
Distracted by the thought of the destination 

Five souls suffering & unable to begin to voice the matters-at-hand
At full-capacity with present journey
Up hills looming over the Downtown bay
Favoring sidewalks with more shade

A once normal world betrayed as an alien-state
To a group so fused in the throes of turmoil
_

Miss broke the silence 
'I am Miss
'We have not formly met

'I already know your names
'No need to introduce again
'Tho it would be polite

Communication took time to digest
After the miles & silence of misery
They just continued dumbly

Miss paitent
'I have been attached by operation  
'Jewels offered
'As sacrifice to Dagon

'To introduce Dagon to the unanointed
'Is an oath-breaking death-sentence

Jordan smirked
'Everyone knows Dagons Eve

Miss visibly irked
'Then explain him in one paragraph

Jordan realized naught with one

Miss happily continued 
'But I have the favor of the Seer
'So I may do as I please keeping-oathsworn

On the shoulder of the a sidewalk-less street
Pack crossed to a side walk of an office-complex

Miss able to set down the umbrella to focus more of her energy on explainations
Sure of what were only questions to Todd
Only able to derail the sorrow for a short-time

'Dagon is a cosmic god
'Infathomable & Unsaitable

'Earth is bribed to Dagon 
'As an occult offer'n by those of the
'Esoteric Order of Dagon

'A sacrifice of this world
'& All worlds connected by Quantum-Entanglement
'For the bounty
'Past imaginations which gods bestow

'All Earth will be consumed
'Drained dry as Mars

'Great powers lie in this cult's foundations 
'Blessings of omnipotent-powers-uncalculable 

'Some envision the gift of infinite-life
'Indesuptably to be as god themself

'I am one of those in faith of Dagon
'All is worth in exchange for a god's blessing

'Jewels is the daughter of a wealthy family

'To pay the price of a family to join 
'Prime of their seed must be given 

'Truthful it is an honor not a curse

'I am 400 years old
'But only a year as symbiotic member of this girl

'As payment into the order 
'Past must live as youth

'Don't be fooled 
'I offer much

'I heal her & repair her
'Myself surgeon centries-in-experience

'I guarntee her life till old age & wise counsel

When Miss traveled to other parts of the body she burrowed
A fleshly-lump the size of a small-ball moved under skin 

Right shoulder her perch 
Baby-arms held the umbrella when not busy describing words
Entire puppet folded-up in thin layers tucks into Jewels shoulder

'We worship the bowels of Dagon

'In Jewels inserted divine-microbials
'This the digestion of the gods

'When I an old woman we found the asteroid

'Tales of Eastern-Monks who under-tourture
'Guided us to a prophetized mountain-village

'Prophecy built on ancient astrology 
'& Deep-cosmic-mathematics could not compromise 

'Decades after mining to the asteroid
'Lead to unprecedented discoveries

'Asteroid contained mavervelous gifts 

'Mound-of-Excrement of Dagon 
'Holy-be-it-Enternally

'Sadly only this small mass of me left
'When the bateria-microbials adjusted to our needs 

'These microbrial bacteria enhance the host 
'Bacteria sentient of the well-being of the host as life-itself

'Jewels is stronger than all you boys combined
'Microbials refine all ingestion & assimilation 

'I myself the first generation to live with prepared hosts
'Viceroy Countess Miss of the Prime Circle 

'If my name doesn't get you out of a pinch
'At some future point when your life is on the line
'Then Imma whores-wet-nurse

They kept to the sidewalks with the most shade & least people
Day burned all pink

Gusts drowned out her voice
Perked of interest they walked close together as Miss's voice did not carry

'Jewels owes us much 

'But she is a foolish girl
'Gets youthful emotions 

'Yes Jewels is foolish
'Myself always busy 
'Patch'n up what she self-inflicts

! WACK
Jewels back-handed Miss

Miss mumbled sorrowfully quiet for a time
! PFT

'Well-I-never-in-my-life
~ hmp

After a few blocks
Miss regained full-compsure

'Tho 
'I am sympathtic 

'To her need to be kept
'From our modular fashions

'Inner-circle ordered her to be pieced
'Into a more sensibly-modified-being

'Operation for this morn 

'Jewels is held by us as a priestess
'Name annointed Jewels by the Seer 
'Who fated her to rise above the most high

'Freckles on her body
'Necessary function to the deep-cosmic-mathematics
'Trick of it to discover how it could settle theorems

'Map coordinates to a universe
'Favored extreme of quantum-possibilites towards everlasting-happiness

'All remade after the image of their best-self

Jordan braved
'best is relative

What he feared hit him with a twang that sang

'Order will seek her out because she is this map 
'This skin even-as-leather will leads us to the universe 

'Freckled-patterns can not be captured 
'The freckles shift & move
'A transient location

'Some sphere which settles 
'Always in 
Miss now self-concious
'favorable situations

She sang a verse
'Eden a rebirth to Quantum Entanglement of all
'Imagine to work life-long in a quest as hero
'Hero of infathomable masses

'Once I get my bod back
'mmmmph

Ben braved
'Why work to keep Jewels out of the order
'You have more than most of your order at-stake

Miss expected such smart over-simplifications
'Fate will bear all to path
'That is my faith 
'A word impossible for youth

Todd defended
'I have faith

Miss chuckled
'Innocence of youth
'Faith is a seed decades

'Now shut-the-fk-up

Miss continued her story

'Only by the boon of Dagon
'After this world is consumed 

'Deep-cosmic-mathematics
'Can then be fulfilled

'Her future has such consequence
'If her skin lost to the Order
'It would mean the end of this most-unique possibility
'Which some reveer rightly as a command from god
'Sign for the faithful

'Power currents have drawn Jewels
'First to wealth, then to the Order
'Now away from the Order
'Many rather guard leather
'Than this girl who has such free will

Jewels red hair caught the beams of sun
A royal beauty no patchwork could mar
Strange girl who even now drew them together
Men cat-called out to her & women envy

Miss continued after they crossed the street
'Only one of our Entangeled-Possibilities needs to reach this destination
'Fate the power which will drag all divergencies to realigned perfect trajectory

'To trust in the power of Fate
'Future to have power to change the past

'The sacrifice of all
'As payment for all to attain
'A more perfect existence

'Our order alone
'Decides for all 
'In solemn manners

Commerical zones now faded to residential streets
Schools, graveyards & empty-lots

Miss stayed herself a while 
Jewels needed to regain strength
Not easy for Miss to talk while Jewels walked 

'The Esoteric Order of Dagon 
'Dates to mankinds earliest history 

'Trends have taken its symbolism to idolitary 
'Fools will be pretensious 

'The Image of Dagon
'Alone necessary 
'To wield unobstructed power 

'Molecules bow to will
'Exerted in presence of an Image

'I myself am a prophetess ordained by the Seer
'The Seer secretly entitled me
'Follow paths by accordance to Jewels

'But the force of the whole-cult 
'Too much to stop

'Someone so imporant must be improved as insurance
'Every day new demands which I alone could not save her

'Thunder of Jordan woke us 
'Providence gathered all 
'To rescue us out of an unbreachable-system 

'Knights & heroes pale to the deeds 
'Which you have yesterday fulfilled

'It only at the cost
'Of only half a tongue

Miss proclaimed as if it a blessing
Miss odd company to have 

Only thing pleasant
On the long stretch to Todd's house

Sun hot in the hours after noon
Lights on in Todd's house

Todd burst inside heart-in-throat
Eyes readjusting to the different-light

The smell of the outside
Inside the house 

Broken windows shatered under his shoes
Leaves whipped-up under family-portraits

Forms of countless-cats at once made out infesting every shadow
First one then counts embattled cat-hisses 
Felines sprang into prowled agression

A large Calaco immediately charged Todd 
Heft of it large-muscles-buldging-tense

Todd had two-smarts-on it
A kick & a snatch

Each of his siblings had owned a cat
He pwned these mangey-cunts

10 cats stopped the attack
None of them cared to risk the same demise of their leader

Act duplicated over & over 
Calaco a goolike-mash-upon-the-walls

Fresh pulp of meat arose any kitty salivate
So exquistely-rare the patee 
Despite quelled-up with great fear of the rampage 
Several stopped for a quick-lick

Felines swarmed over something on the maternal bed
Most of the body chewed up but it his mother

Todd began vomiting in the habitual direction of the restroom

Huched-face-first-ass-out across the toilet
Past-prime-pickings now only a gluttonous-feed mass of his father

Todd cleared out his home
Macabre painted in stern-rigtheousness 

Corpses of his parents foamed out of each mutilated orafice
Grey puss foamed over the lines of each scratch

No cat-claw could pierce Todd's thick wool-gloves
_

Neighbors came out to witness the loathesome scene
Guilty & in fear of the boy they all betrayed

None with courage to venture near
After witnessing the horrendous death of the twins
Two basketball-players on the way home decided to aid the shrieks
They returned to the streets puss-filled choked-dead mid-crawl

Police came to get the bodies off the streets but did not interfere further
_

After the last of the cats, past tears 
Todd left the house bathed in warm guts 

Todd used his might to bust the belly
Legs-to-legs above his head 

Cats in lunacy avoided the same fate
Busy in actions which often condemned them in irony

Thick wool golves perfect for pussy-busting
Raw flesh able to breathe
Yet protected from all-else
_

Cats have 9 lives
But they are their own-worst-enemy

Cats take too long to do anything 
Contemplating calculated actions aun to their demise

10s of bodies litered the rooms 

Jules could not walk fast in sandals
Jordan & Ben decided to give Todd space 

Near 100 disembowled-bodies trailed Todd's direction

Over short distance the cat is quick
Over long distance mankind reigns supreme

Aun to naps the cats put-off-guard 
Awoken too late by the scent of gore dripping off Todd 

Over-fence, thru-yard, along-country-road, over-cemeteries, thru-fields
Until finally rocky bays of ocean 

Rock-to-rock in hops 
Crashing waves below

Cats moved with agility 
But Todd still much faster

Todd climbed up birthed in gore 
Only one entry into a thicket-walled-island

Twisted narrow-tunnel opened up to a vast expanse 

Antiquated farm-equipment
Animals of a rare variety
Fire-pits with altars 

One solitary hut built large as a warehouse 
Loomed in the center

Tatched roof to sustain hurricane winds
Edifice had a lifted concrete-foundation

A large bonfire-pit in the center of the circular lot 

Cat with the first warning-message only-just-returned
As if only to introduce the Reaper 

Todd entered the presence of the Witch 
A mess of steaming-mass eyes aflame in vengance 

Crafty & full-of-guile is an old witch
Yet the unexpected blaze of him froze her dead heart

Slow is man to be slain bare-handed
_

When the four finally reached dunes
Cats kept clear of the area
Laid outside the thicket in a counless ring
Too-tired from their massive trip to move

Todd off to himself content to a corner 
_

Jewels stomached her way around the witch's hut
Parts of the witch so-scattered-such she prayed it due-to-hungry cats 

Leatherbound tomes laid upon altars under balconys
Each balcony with a bonfire-pit
Great iron-pikes stood to hook a cauldron
_

City out for them
No where to go but here

Supply of the Witch enough to last years
Water piped from a resivoir the size of a pond 
Kept lifted & covered
Fed by passing torrents

Firewood came pentiful off ocean drifts
Three weeks went by with even less words between them

Each kept alone to their own interests 
Each front of the plentiful fire-pits
_

Jewels absorbed herself learning the ways of the Witch
Ordained with life's calling

Weeks in the study of the tomes
Prolonged-deduction of the state of each pit

Symbols, parts & bowls, mixtures & brews

Miss created a sheild-like-tome bound by iron 
Four-tomes, two-wide two-tall

Leather-pages made from the thin flesh of the abundant dead cats
_

Jordan spent the time in exploration 

Situation of the island excellent
Built from foundation to be off-the-grid
Preserving certain utilities better than County

Island isolated masked to a scene of like-islands on the coast
Each un-traversable thickets  except for small bays

A worn rock cliff dropped off to mellow-deep-ocean-waters 
One leap exfoliated skin in deep-cleanse

Sea life plentiful & transient
Jordan now satifisfied his ultimate-desire
Self-sustenance upon fresh meat killed by his own hand
_

Ben & Todd in similar circumstance
Understood each other as entirely divergent based upon their reactions

A global power now aimed to get them at any cost
Sent cat-assassins of wiccan conjury
Ben's dad murdered in an unknown way

The price they had paid for their decisions heavy
_

Miss sung at night
'Song of every bay 
'Existence in seasons
'Day after day
'Today is only
'Just another day

Todd & Ben both well-healed in time
In the careful-ways of slow-healing

Ben powered his laptop at the solar-power-station

Todd kept day-long meditations, prayer, & exercise

Jordan lived in peace as if finally repaid from turbid years 

Jewels shielded with an enshrined Tome

Miss ever diligent to guide & grow Jewels talents into abilities

Driscol permenantly-closed
Five pieced together fact from hear-say around town

5 girls went missing 

One girl rumored to have shit in the same restroom
Shit so terrible the janitors refused to clean it

Other girls all over the age of menstration

An outbreak at the hospital cost the lives of dozens of patients
Rumors of fish monsters 

Consequence of unintentional disaster laid upon Todd heavy

Past month chaos in the city
Under worldwide spotlight & slander 
_

Jewels & the cats kept to each other fondly
Cats avoided Todd at eyesight

Reveering Todd with gifts only as he slept

Dead rats, fish, crabs
& Plenty of money & chains

Todd took to a massive religious-piece
All made in gold large-enough-to-wield
Heft of it a precious-relic

Feline robbers stashed funds daily
In payment for fresh fish Jordan caught & Jewels prepared
All after the manner of the Witch

Jewels learnt all their names
& Kept a ledger for their transactions
_

Lengthy-trip to the city took half a day

Store a feast paid for by the cats 
They stuffed their packs with supplies 

Sacks of food tied to their packs
chocolate twinkies bread peanut-butter cheeses dried-meats pasta
_

Baytowns pull in lost-loiters world-wide

Each soul on drift with the tide
Drawn to far-away spheres

Downtown library sat on the hill 
Homeless hobos just below

Library kept an overgrown field to the back 
Lot left alone as a wild thicket

No-homeless succeeded in making any part of the thicket habitable 
Vegetation a fresh-density even fire could not conquer

Unknown to the city the lot had open-access to city water via an exposed water-line
A river of water from a pipe flowed thru it & continued to town

Fuel in limitless supply & limited-area 
Location dense & impassible
_

At the turn around a corner-side-tree
Jordan entered the shadows of the lot
He lifted a bush-arm to reveal a small path 
He stopped to turn & look at them
Jordan's characteristic move meant something serious

'I really feel sorry for you
'Trust me
'I do

'But keep the bitching down
'There are hobos all around

Crawling, packs-first thru a maze 45 minutes 
Trail looked to be made by a rabbit

Walls too narrow for an adult
Most movements snagged in unseeable ways

Relentlessness if tried true rewarded a scathed-body to an open scene of civility
Canopy overhead a ceiling, but all bright lit by lampposts which borderd a grassy pathway to a small-building
_

All bled

Jordan said to their bewilderment
'I put those thorns in myself

!!! WHAT

'Alright-fk-off

'I was much 
'Much bloodier
'Each scaring day
'Than you are now

'Took me 
'All winter & five jackets

'But look at it
'A fkn-fortress 
'In the middle of Downtown

!daymn
'Love being forced to make the path
'A way too terrible for anyone else
'But the person who knows the end

No one in the mood to buy into-that-reasoning
_

Dim-lights lit the completely-enclosed concrete-path 
Miss admired-always for her cheery-perspectives

Miss pointed her shaft at a metal line

'Above look 
'Fouundation of this canopy
'These heavy cords
'Attached to the posts

'All for damned Carnival-DesMondes

'If there weren't such 
'Death to the tale I'd call it a-hoot-ta-boot

'Arrogant-migrant-workers disrespected the tropical-storm
'City warned them 
'tsk-tsk
~hmph

'Only-just set-up-just-drunk 
'When the storm struck 

'Torments built into a Hurricane 

'From different-lands is different-fish 
'As we say

'Hurricane rearraged this area  
'These cords the only thing left of DesMondes
'No worker nor machinery left afterwards
'They are the foundation for this thick canopy
_

A concrete-path bordered by vegitation & light posts
It led to a utility shed 

Power & water & network

'Fort Thickets
An intricatly-carved-log branded the lot

Miss continued
'This place forgotten the years which followed Huricane Karma
'I remember having walked by it 
'How years hide their gems

'Two-years after Karma
'Only Univeristy Hospital kept open 

'That is why University Hospital has unparalleled off-the-grid-independence
'It is the host of the entire-regions-network

Ben jolted
'The entire region 
'Networked to the same place
All his route-tracers returned bogus-information

Jordan explained
Bringing the focus back
'My grandpa worked here 

'On a research-project on our ancestors
'Several fotos of my grampa
'Taken a different parts of this place 
'At the time the grass up to the street

'I spoke to a librarian about the place

Jordan pointed to a framed paper on the wall
'Ganked it from the Library

Old schematic the original building plan for the utility shed
'Hardly stealing if its doing the paper a favor
'Better placed framed for me than forgotten forever by a city
_

All took comfort in the utilities & 6 impenetrable walls
A makeshift shower a hose & drain walled off by a tarp

Welcome after the rural lifestyle of salt-water baths
All together in the only room missing only the comfort of fire

Jordan rationed the supplies 
Passage of life ever on serious decisions
Levity & carefree actions never native to Jordan nor Jewels
Now lost entirely to Todd & Ben

Jordan last to sit in the circle
'One night past-midnight
'Stuck on this side of town

'Crackhead-muthrfkrs 
'Everywhere tween here & Industrial

'Cold-front storm hit unexpected
'Rain soaked everywhere without four walls

'Security guard saw me 
'Loitering and maybe crying 

'He called me inside
'Let me stay until his shift ended at 6am

'I ate half of his lunch 
'So cold I drank an entire pot of coffee
'Never could stomach the taste before

'Man I wanted to bathe in the sink so bad
'But that would have freaked-out the guy

Jordan looked to the others
In confirmation the action non-conventional 

'Coffee kept me in good-spirits 
'Snuck out with the building-plan

'I used pure force 
'Couldn't stop the pursuit until I arrived
'Literally

'Rain didn't breach the canopy 
'As long as I tunneled I kept dry & warm

'Rabbits kept the path distinguishable
'Much easier to get thru back-then

'I had to brute-force some parts
'Hell quarter-mile crawling
'Switch-backs & shit 

'Impossible with the schematic 

'I knew the shed still there 
'If only four-posts & a ceiling

'But as you can see it kept good-condition 
'I did some trimming but the lamposts & sidewalk-path kept neat naturally
_

Cabin Fever a bite of polar difference
Four rested on japanese-tatami-cardbord

Electricity filled their time 
Carefree life begs obsession

Ben took a trip with Jules to return with the computer
This place more stable for electronics
Code now everpresent on the network

Now understanding the occult fundamentals of how the regions network established
Over-time able to find the patterns in the gateways of packet-traffic 

Direct link to network allowed him to forge packet addresses
A large amount of traffic passed thru the Library as bridge to the inner-city
_

Ben hustled on an underground network he help enhance
Able to secure deals-around-town
Rides, chores & groceries

Delievery drops loot at specific place & thes in mapped to payment

Deal today consisted of transistors, pop-tars, Mtn-Dew ...
Well-tipped driver offered to throw in an 1/8 of shrooms & marijuana

Ben mistook the slang & accepted 

Ben sent him the location of the payment
'$100 taped in the bottom of a bench at the Selena memorial

Jordan oathed them all to wait for an hour in the bush before entering
One of various imutable oathsworn protocols none dared breach

Feline theives financed Ben's assortment of computers
Stable pillars the foundation of a p2p network
 
Constant whir-of-activity greeted him as he opened the door arms-full-of-supplies

Jordan immediately popped up surprised 
'dayyymn dat danky
'what-choo-got-der

Bored cabin fever drove them all to sift hungrily at the supplies
Despite an inexhaustive trove of funds supplies always difficult had

'Jewels will like those
Miss said overlooking the rummage 
Rod perusing thru the items
Flinging items here & there

Ben snaped angrily
'Watch it Miss

Named used as curse matching the tone of bitch
Miss gave it to him & they both went at it

Jewels inspected the bag of shrooms lost curiously 
Branches of marijuana & shrooms on her wooden-bench
_

Jewels irate she didn't have a new tongue
Miss replied tartly
'Tongues don't just grow-for-the-pickings
'Where am I to get a suitable source & workstation
'A local hobo
'I dont want herpes 
'Get it every-time
_

Cats everywhere except around Todd
They had their own, quicker, narrower paths to the shed

Jules exchanged with each of the cats 
Pimping new cats nightly each arriving with offerings

Her gifts of friendship
Mixtures of feline perfume 
Jewelry & cat apparel

Cakes to fill with energy
For sex, strength, intelligence
Or skull-fkd-delight

Once-decimated-ranks rapidly grew & grew
Witch focused on control of the cats with orders
Jewels expanded on it with ways to express mutual interaction
_

Blood is thick with identity
Composition stirred by emotion

Blood magic draws from deep-cosmic-wells 
From which all mankind united as brother

Brew of shrooms & blood-dreched-mint leaves
Miss worked the mix into a pact of blood

Split in unbroken-chants
Chants of each all in circle in turn
Gratitude Respect Admiration Forgiveness

Trance-State-Jewels painted an intricate DIAGRAM
Great symbol encompassed each individual into the whole

'May the blood split
'Bind us five more tightly
'For affinity each to other
'Bond one to another 
'Enriched by bonds of another to another

Legs out connected formed a star
Cauldron laid center-circle boiled over gas stove 

Faggot of rolled marijuana & herbal mixtures
Prepared by the inexpicable mastery of Jewels

Vapor of boiled shrooms
Thick-earthy smoke filled the room

Miss lead their prayer, ended in handsigns
Hot brew now cooled able to indigest

Hours-upons-hours
Moon till noon
 
Movements all-surfing-the-same-wave
In-tune at different positions of the swell

Agony of discomfort
Powered the motion as fuse to weld all as one

Each looked across other in reknewed understanding
Familiar whispers assured strengthened bonds 
_

After the hours of fasting 
Cleansed-via-vomit

They took their always-packed-packs & left Downtown
Long trek thru the rabbit-tunnel passed forgotten

Instead of the left turn towards the Dunes
Jewels lead towards her old school Uptown

Miss began her story
Sure of Jewels purpose

'This school is the one of the famous Duties
'Boot-stomping-bruiser-dikes

After a quick look around at blank faces
Unsure if it drugs or ignorance elaborated

'I am sure you have heard of them
'Movie of them still is famous
~Bristly As An English-Boar

'Assigned to troll at Ray High 
'The two marched around so loud
'Impossible to take them seriously

'I knew the two personaly
'Eager to use the material of our encounters
'As material of jest to lead my social groups into laughter
'Which karma hit me back as I proved  long-the-fool which is yet to be forgotten

'After decades passed the women finally put to the test
'An abductor, of no small size, took a girl 
'She screamed & screamed over his shoulder 
'Jughead sure in his strength as stoopid

Ben interrupted
'Yeah I've seen the end 
'Faces of Death covers the last-leathal-10-min-of-the-brawl
'I thought one of the sisters died

Miss hooted 
'Disfigured but then again who can tell the Twins never were pretty
'Man got it ugly
'Face all mush after the elder-sis curb-stomped-his-jaw

In the shade of large buildings
School now came into view down the street

'Corpus held the record for highest kidnaps in the world
'For centuries
'Since that incident the city off even the national list

'Old age has its toll
'3:30 - 3:45
'Neither can keep their eyes open
'Lure of sweet rest into blissful wakefulness

'We have five minutes 
'Be quick

'If you see two woman coming at you
'Drop the bikes & run

Three boys blindsided in paniced-confusion
! WHAT

'We came here to steal bikes
'I didn't have time to explain
'But a warning is all you need

'Pick one fast & quiet or get face-stomped

They dove thru the entrance 
Snuck under the booth 
On-que slept the two

Every action worrisome for them 
Jewels stitched & with unseeming passager

City authorities on the alert 
This venture had to pull off smooth
Stressed persperation bloomed from their palms
_

Lot of bikes open for choosing  
Unchained due to confidence in the Duties
Whom knew the owner of each bike

big small large neon pimp rusty caged
A selection unparalleled by any shop

Several bikes front on gold-painted rack
All other bikes allowed respectful space

Jules immediately lifted the foremost-bike on her off-shoulder 
She held the pedal with her hand

Miss chripped
'We are ready 
'Hurry hurry rats

Her bike a tricked-to-shit-bmx 

Todd took a practical road-bike after a measurement-mount
Sturdy after a decade of use

Ben hoisted up a rugged mountain-bike
Its puffy tires had a relentless attitude

Jordan sweating under his load

! are you shitting 

Four whispered in unison
Pimped-out bike ostentacious

Present no place to debate
They swiftly headed out

Following Jewel's hand motions
Silent directions to keep the bikes from making noise

Unobstructed back out on the streets within 5 minutes

After the corner turn they shouted & hooted
High-speed down-hill top-speed

Four bikes bullied lanes
Blasting out onto the coastline

Jordan on a lowrider bike 
All set in chrome
Pimped-with-gadgets-lights 
Kicked-back-position drew his left lip in cool-smirk
His pack bound to top of the front tire to balance load

Finally off the high from the brew back rested bayside 
Front bonfire under night-sky at the Dunes
_

Able to act free
All attention to the moment

Each lost & gained much worth longlasting-contemplation 
Lonely states allow the soul susceptible to higher states of being
Re-enforced by need to rebuild from rubble demolished states of being

Jewels never kept from work 
From creation of bews, mixutures, herb-dehydration
All made by hands of craftsmen of dual-minded-expertise

They all stared at Todd's replication of the DIAGRAM Jewels had drawn
She replicated it on a virgin part of the dunes at South-Moon
Large stones laid as the outline

DIAGRAM singular in fashion 
Magnetic bonds pulled all tangibly to sit in their placements
Sand shifted to form acute angles in manner defied science

Miss began
'All are connected by quantum-entanglements
'To kindred spirits which inhabit spheres impossibly-far

'Bond a constant proof of infinity 
'Distance of null impact in quantum functions

'Bonds drawn deeper in interactions of dreams 
'Experiencing lives of others as Passangers

Cloud moved from the sliver of waned moon
Air often splashed with water particles sent high by waves to land on their skin

'Dagon

'His echo from AEons       
'His might truth

'Nations seek to call him forth as a gateway to divine gifts
'Tho all their world stripped upon his arrival

'Distance which seperates the cosmos is unfathomable

'Quantum properties testify 
'All realities that can pass will pass

'When one given choice possibility-nexi created
'More divergent the possibility the stronger

'One creates universes layered over the past
'& Recalculated destiny thru consequence of action

'Possibility-Severance occurs when two-liknesses diverge to irrevocable-paths

'Distance tween cosmos is unbreachable 
'Aun for the Holy Dagon

'Contact thru human spirit consortium 
'Loop-hole exploited to sumon Dagon

'All hearts to power the other in a robust network
'Enacted together in massive movements 
'To entangle a reality thru hacks developed over aeons
'More powerful than Magnet, Gravity, or Love
'To entice Schrodinger's Cat
'To pull Dagon thru 
'In need to satisfy cleanliness of certain warped-entanglements 

'Ancient traditions passed down thru ages of civilizations 
'Led the order to confirm evidence found on an ancient-asteroid
_

'A rite to directly communicate across realities
'Experience to be shared across universes 
'Cleared of the fog of sleep into alertness of clarity

'This DIAGRAM given to us as a public gate 
'Our private understanding & connection with the symbols 
'Key illustrates authentic intention 

'A ward of protection from dagerous-minds set to lure into traps 
'Possibilities prove always more wise & powerful versions
'Know us as we truly are in objective perspective

'Each is their own-worst-enemy
'Each in an Order of Ourself

'Symbols associated daily 
'With their emotional attachment
'These are the armor of the soul

'Five of us strong together
'Each as corner for other

'Our rite will be in the position we assumed during the shroom-brew
'We will bind our hands & legs in sleep during these rites 

'By purchase of comfort
'We attain a way to project to other realities
'Casting our mututal connection there in that sphere
'To draw our group to unite there 

'Able to learn on a scale of infinity 
'Which will all confirm singularity in a situation

Position tho uncomfortable laid-natural
Only a nudge dropped them down full-swing

All woke each in a different quantum reality

000000 TODD   000000000000000

All the world under a dome of earth 

Illuminesent-roots dangled dripping light from the roof 
Plants glistened in shining marvels layered the ground
Each uniquely-florescent in liquid mathematical-patterns

A boy swung a giant sword which passed thru all uncontested
Plants burst a cool mushy tastfulness of sticky goo
Todd sure it an intoxicant

Each bite gorgeous 
Yet none allowed any sense of nutritional fulfillment

Movement hurried but anchored in a pace of endurance  
A steady stubborness carried a hopeless-heart
Defeated yet unable to change course

He stopped to make hand-signs & speak
'My dog

'I need to find my dog
'Voice is passed to you

In any dream prior Todd could never distinguish himself
Now a clear-headed distinction of the presence of two

Boy made an impatient-questioning-gesture
Jordan came to mind

'Dogs
'Dogs logically gravitate 
'Towards high corners in a dome
'Like the one ahead of this gorge

Todd spoke but the words Jordan's

'Echoes will seem to originate from each large-corner 
'Corners will draw the dog naturally 
'Each path you make will leave a trace 

'Your hack-n-slash tunnel will be a simple trail for a dog
'Your scent is carried in all this goo that drips off you

'More corners you check
'More opportunites for the dog
'To come across & catch your scent

Unexpected to a sudden bloom of hope
Joy burst in the boy from the epiphany

As a laugh in a quiet-room
Todd severed from the spurt 

Todd lurched up-ward still-cuffed

000000 BEN    000000000000000

Darkness 
Darkness but a candle

Turnt towards black-walls of glass
Partitioned by of different colors of ASCII text scrolling down 

Hands worked fast over many keyboards 

Keyboards laid all over on massive workbenchs facing the wall
candles memorabilia research-papers code books tea-set 

Lurching around in rolls
Man wheeled him-self about
Automatic-habitual-paths worn into wood floors

clickity clack clak 

Colorful code displayed on various terminals
Each reviewed over & over

Ben could follow and understand some logic
Tho alien-syntax all machine interaction only 1s & 0s

Characters poured down the wall as waterfall  
Each to fill him with satisfaction never-so-deep

Man merely scan or rapid-fire commands
Then immediately push-on to the next station  
Searching for anomolies or confirmation of work done

Ben digested the code & commented passively
Man gave no immediate signs of listening
But at times a slight pause of typing then steered towards Ben's ideas


Man grabbed a well-used box-vaporizor tube on the bench
Ben recongized the smell of marijuana

'Give me guidance 
'I have gone
'As far as I can 

With a swift habitual movements his hands made signs
Thumb connected to last two-fingers
Second & Third up stiff 

sun-pose => fall => inhale-smoke-rise => hand-sign => lower-exhale

Man took a razor to cut a symbol into the workbench
Stood-up & stepped-back proudly at the panorama
Went to the printer to grab a blank sheet of paper

What looked like artwork revealed Jewel's DIAGRAM

Ben's eye jerked open 
Darkened by Todd's-shadow-siting-up
Fire longsince-burnt-out 

000000 JORDAN 000000000000000

Work 
Every second dragged

New customer
Same complaint

New room 
Same mop

In & out 
Dreary-life

Forced as cog in a inescapable system 

Pentance
Guilty of poverty
child-of-the-state

~Believe in yourself
~You can survive alone

~Take heart & leave this all behind
~Your older brother can go to hell
~For stealing your last paycheck

~Boss here is a one-of-a-kind-muthrfkr
~Use your next paycheck towards 
~a pack, bed, tarp, & weapon

~All will work itself naturally

000000 JEWELS 000000000000000

Jewels radiant
Sunrays sparkled off her light-amber-hair

Her eyes emeralds
Her tongue wet 

Bike hopped 
Rail-to-wall-to-flip

Sparks trailed her as she grinded on a bench

Person shouted partly aroused 
There a deep well of sexual desire

He looked down at roadbike-cleats 
Clicking metalically back to the roadbike

00000000000000000000000000000

All awoke together but all felt the exit natural 

Time null
Dimension past traditional lines of perception

'This symbol here 
Ben redrew the polygon sign the man etched in the work-bench

'I want this tattooed across my knuckles
_

Jewels poked with a sunbleached fish-bone
Steadied-by-her-lack-of-empathy-for-pain

Dipped in root of an herb & ink of octopus 
Peppers & other mixtures to accenuate the fine lines

Symbol beautifully portrayed upon Ben's left-fist
Augmented by the artistic-mastery of Miss 

A simple-but-intricate masterpiece
Black-symbols turned to light-brown-red under the sun

Project became an ordeal which never stopped
Symbols & Shapes expounded from knuckles up the arm
Amplified in patterns of certain-dreams
_

Night prior fumed rites of sativa induced sleep 
Dunes on Friday dawns after a closing-bonfire

Wakeful dawn tides set calm-stages 
Passive scenes for pre-planned actions 

Todd first-every-morn trained habitualizing mind & body

Dr. Yang-Jwing-Ming taught him the fundamentals & forms
These forms he practiced then move on to shadow-boxing

Others always very helpful to spar against
Each had their own style of agression
Jewels a clever brute force all-in push
Jordan only ever defensive, while Ben grappled

Ironic that time in the girls the day they met the only ever win
Ben now had mastered the counter to Todd's technique with a greater vice

Two hours left his body exhausted but his mind awakened
His prayers coupled with yoga poses

Prayers, contemplation, mantras, readings, writing
Western praktice of sacrifice hardened his core with repitition & resilence

Most decisions in life have no bearing to good, evil or neutral
Philosohy & sciences oriented his decisions always to gravitate to a larger reason

Thru the use of constant & everpresent themes
Todd praktised artes of instant divination

Tho moments entirely new & relational
Distict endgames laid out apparent doors

Todd noted all their dealings in a record which he kept without fail 
_

Adventure returned them always to the city
Flock migrations in tune with the season

Spot to spot to spot
All knew the destination
If seperated they'd meet at the next spot

Each had a pack of their core items
Each location had accumulated stashes
_

Miss kept on Jewels to grown her own plants

Power of plant-magik
Unlocked thru engeries of service given to the plant
Sexual-pain in orgasm of the pluck
Never to cut them only guide them with cords

Soil not plentiful at the Dunes
Nor the enviornment kind to plants
Gusts kept all vegitation stunted 
Salt dehydrated all to a hardened bark

Massive acres of Texas farmland surround the city
Miss sure of some region to sneak a garden
A hidden cultivation of plants with access to irrigation
Harvest moon waned to orange/redish tints
Forgotten & unused acres obvious as cultivated lands weeks past harvest
_

Friday nights alotted for long-suffering-adventures
Jewels had nurtured month-old-plants
Each nested on the bikes

Tonight a long ride to the outskirts
15 kilometers to arrive at the border

These plants would find home or die
Roots could not sustain a return journey

Jordan welded a hitch for a one-wheel-trailer 
Pimped-position kept his feet outstresched ahead
Riding low against minimal air-resistance

Agitation on the plants unavoidabley to scar them with a sense of insecurity
Roots would grip peaceful-plains with a steadfastness from the experience 
_

Across town & down roads past horizons
Each passing truck honked
Calling them out as stranger: noticed & remebered

Holligans up to no good
Plants probably drugs
_

Hours passed into moonlight

Jewels finally stopped arms skyward outstreched
Sensing the energy of a wishful-place

Miss affirmed with air-of-pride
'Yes 
'Deep-water in the air

'Jewels your ability is second-to-none
'You dear gem

Jordan keen to practical-ingenuities
Bikes stashed inside an overgrown-roadside-drainage

Jordan always covered them with a dark tarp
He locked the set with his handy-chain

'Bikes will leave too obvious trail
'Without the bikes, if we move careful
'Passerbys won't distinguish the foot-path
_

Jewels carried her pepper-plant
Strand her variation based on the Witch's main-root
Heavily grafted with modifications

Peppers kept off parasites
Peppers helped keep meat
Leaves produced thick-smoke

10 Acres they walked single-file
All infested with dark-red-ticks
 
Mosquitos & gnats feasted 
Bugs bit at their salty-sweaty-bodies in a frenzy

A small hill loomed in the horizon 
Leakage off the hill made the path difficult

Mud caked their shoes till ankles
Shins sliced by serrated-leaves

Jordan pointed at rusted-hinges of the gated hill shut for decades 
Overgrown the gate could only be hurdled

Signs of long-abadonment
An old camp chair next to a rusted-thru-tin-bin 
Decades-old-crushed-beer-cans crunched everywhere

Strewn about odds-that-spoke-of-a-person who kept this place as private-quarters 

Miss commented still worn from the journey
'It must have been a miserable-fool 
'To keep this parcel-of-hell a lounge

Jordan said assured of the hill 
'This is definitely manmade

Tho molds of the hill had longsince-become-organic
'Plains-dirt causes this shit-pit
'No cohesion to let the water run smooth

They twisted & curved, blazing up overgrowth

Plants thick & greedy for space
Full of things which crawl & bite
Foliage 10-feet-high at places

Path broke to grassy knoll at its summit 
Plateau larger than what-looked-possible-from-below

A dark plane circle lay flush with the ground 

Miss had a habit of annoying them with her poetry
'A dark portal  
'Sacred pillar

'Reflection without ripples 
'Harvest-moon bore mirrored

Each soaked the sweat & tourtures of raw flesh
Little fish nibbled away the crusts of skin & ticks

Miss explained 
'Downtown Memorial architect
'Once described the difficulty of the process 
'To engineer a water-mirror

~proof of mastery
'Where his words

'Here is one formed by more than happen-stance 
'Reflection adapts stabalizing to perfect reflection

Wild grass held a lush Kentucky Green, cool & soft 
Blades of it clung as moistured-gauze
Balm on tired, bit & sun-baked-flesh

Two hours past in preparation of the banks 
Four turned the soil with whatever-worked at hand

Removed grass replanted in care
So beautiful the summit vegetation

Jordan retrieved the still-serviceable barbque-pit 
They alloted a section of the bank for the DIAGRAM constructed with washed-pebbles

Miss conducted rites over metals, wood, mineral
Marijuana dashed over the top
Each hovered over the flames chanting after Miss

Plants first incensed to calm their nerves
Planted atop the rite materials as bed to the roots
Set to be untouched for a time

Dawn broke as all positioned at the DIAGRAM
Taken by sleep upon carpet of Kentucky Green

Japanese doors exposed sections of the outside world
Bright noon-sun shone down a forest pond covered by lily flowers 

A giant python lay in the heat of the day on the bank
Cat's neck stretched overtop a coil resting-secure

Curated-gardens of same plants Jewels transported to the pond
Soil turnt a rich-dark of ground-coffee-beans & shit
_

Large wick candle blazed-crackily at center of the room
Tatami floor left a square cement pit for the candle

A thin-metal-couldron boiled hung-over the candle
Metal worked gold into a unicorn among forest animals

Each crossed-legged across other around the couldron
Boys in simple alcoyte clothes 

Jordan looked healthy in shocking distinction from lumpy
Ben was muscular with a thick black beard but a balding-scalp
Todd a plump chinese adorned by the same relic-cross

Chants crept groggy concious
Mint perked-attention of the passangers 

'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh
'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh

Words melded to their minds
Unable to capture the words as one grasps smoke

Jewels eyes burst open
! the arrival

'3 long years to summon 
'Many have come & gone
'But only thee we seek

Jewels spoke in firm-beauty
Perked at the adoration of her voice

Prophet adorned by all-fine-things
A tiara laid by fine workmanship 
Fish-bones & pearls worked into gold

She bowed in introduction
Motioning boys to stand
'I am the Prophet of La Gatenau

'Our monk life paid in sacrifice
'To bless infinite-realms
'In life-mission to seek you five

Jordan passed a cone of marijuana wrapped in dry tabacco-leaves
Puff-puff-pass & handsings in synchronized unity

Eyes closed & linked forearms
Chantes continued

'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh
'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh

From darkness grew a purple dot
Slowly the dot grew into an orb

Surface of the planet uniform
Megolithic dust storms swirled in simple patterns

Jewels voice came to their minds
'A simple devastation
'Earth processed into purple dust

'Image a herald to the doom of your reality
'Doom tied to all in a flood of inevitablities 

'Each Earth in turn nullified 
'To prove the singularity that all serve as  meal to the god DAGON 

'Prepare

'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh
'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh
_

Wakefulness slow
Entrenched in the chant intelligble due to dryness-of-mouth 

Eyes damned by mucus cracked open by tears-of-agony
They drug heavily to the water to soak hours 

Jewels too put-out to set out a healing-vapor
Jordan familiar to miserable situations able to get a tarp laid

All put-out & passed-out on-and-off
Unable to sleep-deep thru present-misery
_

Hunger woke them hours later 
Jewels urged them cautious
'Eat slow

Movements in meloncholy for the longing of speech

Instant Jewels woke Miss collapsed of exhaustion
Jewels carefully kneaded her down into her nest

Trance lasted two days & nights
Prophet Jewels dealt them great harm 

To wretch them in suffering-unparallel

~Prepare
A message cost agony
Themselves they found ones greatest enemy
_

Moment Miss woke
Miss creaked out
'Dagon will be summoned
'No force can stop
'a gateway built by
'thousands of years

'great minds of the world failed
'pent-up power so great
'the order can only succeed

With no food forced into a laborsome-journey to Jordan's nearest location
Behind a car-lot near a highway 
Old water & dry food to soothe them back to health

Next-winter-months at the Library
A bitter-time of sunless-days under a moist frozen canopy 
Passive to the paths of constant-northern-gusts 

~ fK-this-damn-stub
Jewels communicated by unmistakable gestures

Jewels argued with Miss in cabin-fever
Miss often only rapt Jewels on the head

Hot but stuffy in a one-room-building
Silent in misery

Jordan spoke up
'Lets go back to the Dunes
'Rather have a few bad days
'Than have all shitty ones

'For-fks-sake

'We all have a public bowel clockwork 

'Jewels shits 6am
'Todd always at 7:13
'Ben shits after lunch
'I shit before sleep

Ben snapped back annoyed
'I cant pick up & leave

Keystrokes hammered his mood audible

'Code takes time to set up
'Before I can think of walking away

'We might not come back for a months
'Major pillars of the Undernet based here

Todd pointed out simply & reinforced with suspicion
'We been here over a month
'Aren't you always on about how you can get same access anywhere

Ben got up from the computer tilted towards a backlash

'Dude I tell you the same things always
'I am refining mechanics

'But to refine the mechanics in code
'I got to take it apart

'Let me rebuild the modules then we go
Ben had gotten back down to begin typing
After ten minutes passed

'A new drop is coming
'Jewels

He turned toward her
Jewels hissed at him

'Trailer for your bike

Her smile melted the fever of all
Happy the rest of her day in merriment

A week required to prep the trailer with all required layers of paint
Mandatory before Jewels attached it to her bike

Todd jealous of the master of Ben to diffuse the situation
'Well we do need coffee-n-shit

Jordan's phrase word all adopted 

Ben resumed his clacks
'Wanted: 1/8 shrooms & lb whole-bean-coffee & jelly-beans

Ben threw an accusative finger at the tatami-mats
'Jordan built those for streching
'Yall need to be busy doing that

'You might not know 
'How you are supposed to 
~Prepare

'But as for me I got a damn-good-idea
'My entire life is culminating into this project

'Mankind is going to battle with some God
'We have no knowledge of how to beat it

'As Todd says I have faith that this projection
'Fit some necessary role in the end

Jordan added to the situation
'None of my skills are new
'Far as me 
~Prepare
'Got it smack-on-tack

Todd ashamed agreed to the same
His strength meditation & contemplation

~Prepare
A high-priced-message of no personal-value
_

Computer-arrays heated the utility-flat
Six monitors mounted on the wall

10 machines of various shapes
Wires of rainbow-sort intertwined them

Ben controlled all via his laptop

Results a flow of ASCII down monitors
Mezmerized as a cold flame
_

Jewels & Jordan picked-up the drop

Caffine obnoxiously powerful 
Brew melded into the high
Enlongating time of the trip

6 hours straight Miss convinced them to meditate 
Miss never wrong in these promises

Breatheing in a brew
Cooking over the large flame of Jewels hand-made-candle

Miss instructed
'just a tttthhhh

'no hauking please
'i will hang you on a cross
'rapt you head hard on

Streching each other in pulls 
All bound to the circle

Tomorrow skate-day
Skater-krews all over the city skate spot after spot
_

Ben took a backseat past weary-exhausted
Drank coffee & blunted-up
Green Bull: coffee & blunted-up

Mechanics of Ben's code finnicky & specific
Interfaces must have structural-soundess
Infrastructural network piping industrial-grade

Computer-nodes networked together by homogeneous-unix-kernels
Each tapped into the network on some distributive task

Ben's Undernet launched as in desperate soil of a society too long censored
Files, messages or listings all forwarded in a monolithic P2P cloud 

Regions network packets only analyzed & routed at central
unix still able to spoof a data-packet to another end previously configured with $KEY

Each node independent in a lasse-faire
Nodes of most interest had node $KEY of higher value

Ben long-since exhausted on auto-pilot stated to any who'd listen

'Hard to tell when code is mine or not after I type it
'How much credit can I take 
~tsss

Miss stated 

'One enlightens all
'Neural connections associated with understanding
'Natural paths created by mechanical electrical piping 
'Quantum Entanglements form these neural-pipingings 

'New connection created an echo out to all entangled 
'For one connection dormant forever
'To another a deep well of treasure
_

Jordan always went first to break wind
Low to ground with low-wind-resistance

Jewels next with the Tome trailer
A massive chain jingled in a coil aside Tome

Todd next with Ben to follow
Fat tires heavy in a long-haul

Nearby school lots all empty
Skaterless lots on a Friday
Only meant one thing
_

Vacancy meant skaters migrated
Else one or two be there tricking

Ben drenched in sweat & labored approached an old couple walking their dog
Sight of him startled the couple

~hey you seen a bunch of skaters

Old couple only looked back defensively 
Dog in front held in firm protection

Jordan yelled sommething obscene as they left
_

Skaters convexed at a house-party
On the wealthy-side all-invited
A caged tiger roamed the lot

Host took Jewels to present around
Miss asleep in her stomach

Jewels BMX famous since childhood   
Secret a shock to the boys 

Hype of the gathering
'Jewels & the UnderNET kingpin 
?! Are fucking friends ?!

Ben followed Jewels tail sack of USBs passed out
Todd & Jordan both avoided to be the nobody 

Yet they could hold their own troll
Hard-core adventurers
rolls, rope, gear

People always talk or prove-up
Most never slept outside a night

Solid-advice from druggies
Weathered in the experiece of horrible situations

'I had to drink water from a toilet
'You use toilet paper to filter

'Did you know you could use toilet-paper as filter
'in a nuke-fallout
_

Masion on the ocean side
Room each unique in its own special-way

Krews from each school present
Ben handed out USB like gold-bars

shots hits motorboats-around-the-house

$KEY of the newest sector valuable
Cheap $KEY for new usage

3am Jewles rounded up Jordan & Todd 
Cleaned up Ben crying-drunk

All trailing their own party of people
'need-a-place-any-place

Industrial had a window & door ocean-side
Clothes as blanked & breakfast

Jordan gave the talk
Each in turn oathed

...blah blah blah
third-party-heresay-result-in-our-death

Four of them left the next day to return with bikes
Krew of 8 could manuever anywhere uncontested

Jordan talked up the Garden
He promised it would be an epic-trip

A large girl named Manda
Two twins named Greg & Steve
Kikochi a Japanese temporary 
_

Kikochi played the flute on Jewels request as they appraoched
Song caught with his breath at the sight
A sacred pool in different manners but same fashions of his heritage

Plants saturated the air in a hum
A great-greenery amassed on the knoll
Polished stones bordered the mirror-pool

Greg awknowldged defeat
'What does the cat eat while you are gone
'big-ass-bag-of-cat-food
'caz if so you forgot it

Jewels 
~Millions mice in fields
~Many pests feed cat

Cat speaking with Jewels in short-clear-purrs
Walking her thru tended plants of the Garnden
_

All soaked in the water
Kikochi struggled to accustomize himself to the fish nibbles
'Creepy

Manda dived under & back up to momentarily obliterate moon's reflection
'Makes me feel more natural
'Two organisms in same enviornment help each-other 
'Not exploiting or molesting

Kikochi pointed to his dick
'What you say
'One earlier bit my penis

Jewels splashed his way 
~Ate tick off 
~you got favor

Experience too creepy for the twins 
They only euro-bathed

Night wore on
Four felt a calling near
Each in a darkened-dread

Kikochi finished another song
Chi re-aligned-the-mood

Jordan started to lecture
'We are going to be in a state

Greg accepted eager to cut off an unnecessary rant
'Yea we got you guys

'spray your face with water
'dont laugh when you shit-all-over

Jordan blushed, his shit always diahreeah

Miss directed out the large ceremonial-candle-column
Jewels moved it in pain for how long & tedtious the candle took to make

Thin Couldron full of a gallon of herbs & water

0 united 00000000000000000000

Stillness of infinte darkness slowly unfolded 
Sense of color baby-blue
Smell of salt 

Taste of familiar pull woke them full

Jewels silver-hair tiara
Atop a floating platform

Platform surrounded by mirrors on all sides 
Mirrors enlade by a metal of dark purple hue 

Jewels lower-mermaid-half scales glinted
She drew in a long-thin-cigar

'Dagon the dragon
'Coming thru you

Voice cracked unaccustomed to many words

'I am Jewels Pearl of Seven Seas

'You will lose your battle against Dagon
'That impossible to change 

Mermaid-tail waved the water calmly 
Each saw her from an oculus of a pearl

Seven great pearls rested upon a bed of vegitation
Two un-used pearls were cloudy dark

'Be assured
'Many fates await after the Arrival

She drew them in with a longated-cigar

'What is learned of this first encounter 
'To be transmitted to aid all others 

'Image of Dagon
'A clone entity

'Each reality Dagon links an Image 

'If Dagon killed in one reality
'It will possess the Image in a previous realm
'Infinity upon infinity in chain-link

'Aquatic-spirt delves deeper than humanity
'That portion speaks to a greater bearth of existence

'If Image of origination destroyed
'That origination is your reality

'Dagon sealed-over-time
'Cut off from Earth repelled
'To whence it came

'Lot fated to fail 
'Learn to survive  

All melded as water-drained
Awoke each in front the other
_

5 days past 

Jewels bowed to the four friends
All of whom had kept loyal to duties

~suffering of this time less
~More power for longer time
~More clear the summon

Chili-tea brewed with herbal-leaves
Sustained them quickly to bearable-state
_

Twins rearranged the shed 
All the supplies depleted 

Group managed to produce recipies of the vegetation abundant here
Jewels eager to write them all down astounded with Miss at this discovery 
_

Symbols now major part of their life
Together they set upon a symbol to remeber the moment in a tattoo
Inscribed on the body all had vacant

Flags to awaken a sleepy-passangers to alertness 
Symbol an anchor to keep memory after wake

Mermaid laden with a crest
Tiara crafted into crest
Crest embroidered in pearl-skirt
_

Morn after long adventure 
Crew under hot sun at the crossroads 

Three boys went their back to their homes
Manda stayed with them grateful to be far from home

Easy coastline hills over bare bike-trails
Thru some thickes & back to the Dunes

Full moon & initatory dive into ocean
Despite many wails from Manda

Jordan taughted her afer she came-back-up
! remember
! undertoes will bring you back 
! eventually

! trick to stay alive that long

Manda responded with hysterics
All 7 had to struggle to rescue her

Jewels & Manda took some girl-time
Manda hair too-thick-curly for the sand
They spent long hours molding her dredlocks
_

~fk-the-world
Jules flipped-the-bird

Bonfire in fast from want of food

Todd lead them
'Our reality will be destroyed
'Others will likely forsee it

Jordan inturrupted
'Streets will always have
'Some symbol associated with a movement 

'Like grafiti or flags

Miss added 
'Agreed that is wise
'We must each await this

Todd added disappoined
'Join up with a movement rather than start our own

Ben tossed in
'Our mission is to survive
'Ground-zero will be the most logical cover

Jewels signed
~Eye-of-the-hurricane 
~Or nuke-city

Ben continued
'Image must be secure
'Near the portal will need to be a stable

Todd joined
'Presence on the inside

'Why go thru years of chanting
'To give out a hopeless warning

'All-ever passed-in-this-existence 
'Consumed as meal for one-being-alone

Jordan looked up with a face reserved before a long rant
'Nests-hella-infest 
'Always centers a fat-bitch-queen 

'We know the school 
'Been there three-years
'Who over us best to break-in to the Uni

'Todd you still got the window key

Todd nodded 

Jordan lit up excited
Eyes up in the sky standing arms outstreched circled in the sand
'Finally 
'Xena 
'In my arms soon

All in their own-creepy-experience -that- about Jordan

Manda looked around confused
? Xena

Jewels turned her to herself
~stuffed-giant-panda
~used-for-humping 
~left in Jordan's locker 

Jewels rode the air giving winks at Jordan
The invisible bear threw her down to ride her stallion

Jordan smiled
'Hey our kind has pride
'Xena is only inanimate to those who don't show her love first
_

Regional network routed thru University Hospital 
One key likely existed as a backdoor all data & service

Ben rambled on as he hacked away on his beach-puter
All front a fire
Night-times best for dark-terminals & batteries

'Any pattern would betray itself eventually
'Birthday-coincidence-proof

'Eventually can be hacked quick
'If you are clever enough

Manda opened an adoration
'Ben the most 1337 hacker around
'Damn-son kill-it yo

Jordan caught it
'ttttahh
'I never say kill-it

Ben continued
'Todd you never asked me 
'Why I was chased the day we all met

All chewed roasted-pepperoni 
Front of a bonfire waves breaking near-by 

'Anytime Im at a computer at school
'I waited for a chance to create a listener

'I created code to work-with other nodes I set up
'Set to link together every morning from 1am-4am

'My first major hack

Manda hooted
'pimped-out-them-bitches-like-hotcakes

A long banter fell dead on the audience

Ben took back up
'Each node sent data back & forth in search of patterns
'A simple mod-over data-sets until data parasable 

'When a computation is parsable
'Each node will print it to a printer I hid in a closet

'I jacked the printer from an insurance office
'They fked over our car insurance

Manda shook her head at him disapproved

Ben defended
'My dad stole cash & he was made I only took a printer


'Set it up in the janitors closet under the stairs
'Back part unused and a nearby line to splice

'I decided to hide at the end of the day
'Snuck into the jacket-closet of Mrs. Stevens 

'Stayed in the room with a few bottles to pee-in & snacks

Manda
! OMFG


'I found a closet near a network line
'A janitor closet under the East wells
'To the back by the stairs I setup the printer 
'Spliced it into the network 
'Went back to sleep in the gym until PE woke me

'My dad flip-ta-bich-&-slappped-me-good 
'Turned out my plan to get away with it flopped miserably

'I got impatient & after a month I got desperate
'I waited till the Monitors 
'All returned after their trolls

'In the middle of the hall
'They left to go deal with Todd
'Mr. Dumbass walking around
'Instead they found me

Several cracks were made at Todd's expense

Ben drew them back
'My code should have cracked the key

'I have the code written down
'I know there are no errors

Todd reacted
'You mean you have faith

Ben didn't take the bait
'Breaking into Uni
'Is most important

'An encryption key would plain-text the entire network 

Jordan patted Jewels on the shoulder
All always rightly blamed her for their summons
'Maybe we sell ourselves too short
'Who else in the world
'Could crack that type of access 

'Get the data
'Plant an encrypted-bridge

'All seems prophecy to me

Insomnia the soil of Ben's childhood
Night the time Pops popped-caps

If Ben didn't keep actively moving spots
Pops always managed to find him 
No matter how drunk 

Popped-a-skull worse the-longer-it-took
Decision to run crossed-a-line 
Trespass forgotten after the haze-of-next-afternoon
All rant & abuse until then

~cost of new school shoes
~ones kicked aside-disrespectfully

~coulda ate McDonalds 
~Not the shit-which for lunch
~took his only two free-minutes 
~of the gawddamnday

Ben easily avoided the clumsy-lunatic 
Pops favorite state-of-being

Key to get out of sight
Easier said than done

Once out of sight jump in a nook
He built lights in various places
Always kept a tool-set-flashlight in his pocket
Ben used the time to read

Hiding the best time to read
If Ben caught lounging on couch with a book
Pops triggered like an explosion 

Times he ranted
'If you didn't mark it
'There no point 
'Have'n to remember it
'Der dipshit

'If no point 
'Of have'n to remember it

'Then why the fuck 
'Would you read it boy

'We elect you
'Mayor Dipshit

Lecture under-pinned with pain
A pressure-point to be taught

Ben looked-up to Pops 
Despite his weaknesses as a father

Pops cracked to the core
Stuck as single-parent
Provide all in a hard world

Pops stole textbooks from the city library
Learn Ben up on subtle-arts & tricks too keen for school

Ben waited in the car front the library
Always on rainy days

'Need a reason to stay hooded-up son 
'Two coats to steal-large
'Remember that one

Pop's favorite artic-military-coat

Wisdom imparted in payment for guilt
What remained after hazey memories
Fuzzy witness to own weakness

Gleaming as a redeemed-man does
Passing down a lesson-for-the-ages
Endorphins-high rewarded from evolution

Returned with two large textbooks of random sort
Displayed like hunted-food for a starving-family

Dad always taking Ben as ingrate

'Listen shithead 
'When you get the balls that drop 
'And the skills like mine

'Only then 
'Do you deserve choice 
'Which kind of fruit-of-the-tree you able to eat

Pops a true muthrfkr 
Type to fk around casual 
Leave a virgin stuck with a babe for 2 years

Gathered courage to come back to raise him single-handed
A fact Ben used as pillar to keep the image of his father holy

Day-to-day a kick-around
Fresh memories 

Understood now after months of contemplation
Pops sober-intention 
_

Ben eventually took up the tricks of his father
Ben had a trove of out-of-date-unix-books 
Black-screen command-line-terminals

~To lift up the shell
~To hear the C

Kerigan & Ritchie & Richard-Stevens 
Homogeneous kernel of unix networks
_

Pops gave a USB 
Presented always as payment
After listening to one-of-his-life-lessons

'Shit you never know
'When shit gets real
'Cops be busting in

~oink ~oink

'They search evidence

'& Where is the USB
'Full of all the evidence?

'4 Inches out of the puter
'Down your throat
'Before any seent you

'All incriminating-evidence 
'In your shit
Dad down-to-earth genius
Which he wore too-proudly
_

Each year Pops needed less & less alcohol
Reading a sensitive subject to trigger

Ben caught with a book in one of Pops moods

'Learnt is fine & well 
He slurred & slapped 


'But boy tell-you-me 
'no MAn'd choose 

'bull-onie-bull-shit
'over real-life-skills

Kick Ben out of the room
Kick the book to the floor

'piss on books
'only fools follow

Laughing maniacally as if front audience
Ben with another mess again to clean

The quicker the better
Piss congeals worse each second 

Library full of distorted piss-stained books
All his highlights distored in the wrinkled-dried-paper
//////////////////////////////////////////////
_

Pop phrases always popped back into Ben's mind
'----like fkn cop'
'----like your bitch ma'
'----like ....'
_

Six together around the large pit
Life taken in seriousness requires fast

Ben said accidentally interrupting the silence

'lets see anyone else 
'Takeover a whole region's traffic
'fknmuthrfkr

'thank-god-some-one-spoke
Manda said getting props from Jewels

Miss took the rebellion steamed
~Prepare

Manda up in a rawl in her own laughter

'Oh right wit you gurl
'Just me 
'I prefer to 
~Prepare
'On a full stomach

Food cooled to cold laid as picnic

Front them  busy in a stationary-task
Hours of silence snowballed energies
Entangled to break an understanding

Stronger & stronger each passing second 
Entanglement-united in deep fight of will over matter

Ben on a laptop
Jewels caligraphy, wiccan, potion 
Todd pen-set-out write down histories 
Jordan keep the fire & cook & knot

Hana made comments Jordan was the butler
Jordan replied she was promoted to his job

Miss lectured
'Starvation-bonds a deep well of power
'Exploited by the effect of pseudo-starvation

'Hunger in proximity of-smells-of-food 
'Will quick-trigger a state of pseudo-starvation
'An attempt to use all power to adquire food

'Vast wells of energy
'Fuel power of Passangers

'Starved host receptive
'Passanger acute awake-distinct

'Lessons by masters
'More fortunate in the reality of host-situation

All now ate the cold food in deep gratitude
Somberness an ashe coats pleasures of life all grey 

Difficult to attribute work to yourself
Or product of a silent-passanger

Todd since a child 
Devoted himself to edification
Meditation, supplication & fasts 

Todd only ever migrated
Church to church

To find respectable individuals

Parents failed a long-line of religious tradition
All family-notables lived in religious service

Grand-father had a dark-side around children
Father familiar with family history swore off religion

Todd never been to church with family
Father never once talked about grandpa or church


Dark cults or enlightened-masses
Each obvious to the beholder
_

Miss admited respect for Todd's intuition 
400 years put his example unparalleled

Pools of energy bloomed miracles in Todd's dream-state
He led hosts thru questions to fill holes of understanding
_

Todd rants:

'I commit to morals
'Morals only modified 
'After any act itself
'To stand firm the main point

'Monuments of life 
'Done one day-to-day

'New-doors open-for-one 
'Open for all-who-listen

'Each required to play part fullest

'Jerk-off, play-tag, school
'All time sacrified
'For few lifelong ideals 

'Mathematics & Kungfu

'Kinetic logic built as route
'Stable functions of properties 

'All morn kungfu
'Wake me into algebraic-groups 

'Prayers allign mentalities
'Ease a sleepy-passanger into speak

'Mathematical theory worked into notepads
'Pursuitant the reason why question asked
_

Baby-blue-air lit into amber-orange
Deep summer day radiated heat

Waves full-bloom crashed
You had to sync your jumps
Or You may be crashed too

All only ever crashed once
But each never crashed again

Manda ready to return home to face her family
All in the ocean with Manda tied to shore with rope

Ben mentioned to Todd
'Dr. Yang Jwing Ming's compilation
'Pops stole them all 
'He told me if the chinks discovered
'Yang was selling the secrets of his sacred-culture
'propertay intelicktwoall as the french say
'Ninjas would assasinate the good-doctor 
'Stealing the books essentially helped saved his life

'I also have alot of mathbooks
'Pops stole those for their size

Ben continued

'They are at a storage-container
'We could haul the lot with our bikes

Jordan jumped down still dripping from last dive
Legs tucked to his odd-shaped-belly

'Hella-doe-boys

Long echoe into a crash of water
He swam over to the others at an essa

Jordan presented a plan
'We drop Manda off
'On the way head to the stash of books

'Go thru the books
'Book no-one wants 

'slang-dat-shit 
'fat-wads all-day

Ben countered
'Or mad points
'With the library 
_

Hurricane devestated this section of the bay
Homes long-since-abandoned in decay
Reminder to all short-memory real-estate & forginers

Five in a pack at night on desolate streets
Neighborhood was dark & villianous 

Certain paths led them best ways

** ** ** (stop)
Jordan looked back

** ** ** (stop)
Jewels flashed lamp-code

Three trucks charging down the coast below
Headlights thru streets in the fastest route to the group

Jordan hooted in a small call
'shit-gonna-git-real

Section of the city vacant & decrepit residential neighborhoods
Jordan put them thru the nearest cut-thru
Three street-blocks crossed diagonal

Juked debris & leaped fences
Jewels tome-busted thru two  

Back on their bikes next area 
Rednecks not to be out-witted 

Roar of truck lurched near
Immediately a black mass
Dove into view thru the backyard

~a woosh-of-disaster

Truck bouncing on Supper-Dude-Springs
It crashed thru debris 10m from the crew

Hood over the engine a heavily-fortified hull 
Earth lifted into a scatter to rain upon all

Truck drifted-to-a-J over wet-foliage
Overwhelming in the overgrown yard

!!! HONK 
!!! HONK HONK HONK

Dirt & plants blasted over collapsed fence set between them
Till it rained down over the next building

'Them there it is
! DATS
'Billys Bike!

! GIT EM

A hardy-bearded-oldman screeched in wolf-howl
Stumbling-out drunk or dazed-stoopid-from-the-crash

'My late-wife
'Gave thatta my grand-son 

! Billy

Man stumbled out in a riot of cackles
Only theeth visble three brown teeth

!yall-gonna-paaaain

Speach allowed the krew time to pass out & thru
Two-other-trucks approached rapidly from other block
Enviornment grumbled in groans-of-the-rowdy-passage
_

Hauled-ass thru & then down
street perpendicular street

Movement as a flock 
Jewels in the the lead 

They at times followed to great pain
Unable to match Jewel's jukes always a painful tumble

They curved in circle 
Second-to-last-house 

Past them open grounds
Leave them helpless to be stampeeded

House still kept a sound-structure
No-front-door allowed quick-entry
Swift headlights passing moments after

Todd whispered
!up-the-stairs

Stairs held but the passing soggy

Trucks outside in mad charges as bulls
Nosed thru the neighborhoods lurching

Overestimating the stretch 
Null to their dominant position
_

Trucks pulled around to circle back

A voice shouted
'Billy you keep 
'dat outer-perimiter

'you understand dat sun
Old man illeterated

Ben toke it running
'yeahit

Old man shouting to them

'We
'A gonna handle
'All this here

'That there bike
'Cost my girl some-savings
'life-savings

'& god-damned to yall
'If that helped her heark-attack

Old man called out into a hoot which curled to high pitches
'gaddamn-me
'For what we gonna do to yall

A hoarse, cracked teen voice yeller
'Run-em-down-dead
'As christ on the cross

Howls out windows 
! got my shotty
! pump-yer-ass-wit-salt

!!! ooooohhhhhwwwwwweeee 

!!! YIP

!!! saves-ya-to-feed-as-bacon-to-my-pigs

Five shadows moved as a group into house to next
First pumped in riot bashing-deep-inspection lords of earth

House by house heedless
Effort imperceptiple at such levels of intoxication

Not till umpteenth house the hunt became a labor
A hard & disgusting labor to search abadoned houses
Vomit-inducing sights met them unexpected

A fat man huffed his to gather the squad

! you-wit-me
! bobby-go-wit-earl

' We got this house ere 

Hoots of compliance
!Chk er down
!chk ER down
!chk-er-down

Moments later a crash & bash down stairs
A crash at the stairs followed by a curse

! fuckaroo

'damn-fuck-cock-bite-stair
'jimmny-crickets-whore-of-a-mother


! BOBBY 
! EARL

! pull-er-ass-here
! help-me

A voice went outside to call out
Bobby, Earl & the trucks

! dumbass-dipshit-hurt-himself

Four others helped carry
Wounded grey-beard to a truck

! HEY YOUS
! FUCK FUCKAROOS

! DIS HERE TRUCK
! CALL HER


!!! RUMBLE
!!! RUMBLE 
!!! RUMBLE

! DOOOMM
! HAMMMERRRR

Loud-screech lost itself in the maniacal throttle & Heavy Metal on 808s
Two at each side of the truck hefted hooked chains

Driver rolled down the a window-shield
Truck logo:

~Bobbys Best
~WRECK & CLEANUP

'ole-mother-fucker
'is paid to clear this shit
'how-fucking-funny-is-that-boys

'donet earnt
'yerselves proooofesssionales

A shrill accusative yipped 
! THiEVry

Justified the truck took out the corners of the first house 
Down their side of the block
Two on each side linked the chains to the pillars of each house

! I-aINTA-WURKED-DiS-HaPPy-SINCE-VEGAS
One worker shouted glove on the right hand
A fith-of-something-cheap in his left hand
Leather-utility-belt hung a laborer-hammer

Pace & efficiency alarmed the group

'fuckohfuck
Jordan trapped in despair
'Gotta keep it real

Todd pointed thru lookout window
'They left the hurt guy the smaller truck 

'Imma sneak up behind
'Take him down

Todd convinced them
'We only survive if we get a vechicle
'With bikes we lose

Jordan nodded
'Take over the truck then reverse here
'We throw the bikes in the bed 
'Skurr-skurr for sure
'You got this Todd
'Ill back you up

Jordan offered
Todd declined

'I move better alone
'Just be ready

Tactic relied on surprise
Two meant double=chance to be noticed 

Failure sacrified Todd as distraction 
Chance for others to escape an otherwise sealed-fate
Hand-to-hand combat a dependable solution

Todd left out the kitchen window to follow bushes along the front

Section to section Todd silently 
Snail-movements put him under rear-cab driver-window

A locked-driver-door meant his luck ended 
Tonight not their night to die
A solid thrust up the handle locked-halfway

A voice inside rose
'whadda
! whatdafuck 

Todd's heart dropped
Passanger prepared trick 
~Back Bed

Todd natually in good position swung himeself onto the back bed

Truck lurched as Todd scrambled upright
Four wheel drive thru rumble of the front bushes to land on asphalt of the road

Todd on a bull-of-a-ride
Thrown hard here-&-there

Guy caught-up in manual-transmission with one unusable foot
Old man meant to get to the other truck 

Rednecks always have something in the bed able to break a window
Todd grabbed down at metal-rod

Truck-bed jolted left
Truck crashed his shoulder into a tool box

Wheels purchased pavement again
Todd bleeding but no time to tend wounds

Todd immediately obliterated the back window 
Over-swung-rod continued to a red-line across the-head

! yyyyeaaaaoooohhhhhh

Driver experienced to safe-habits saved both their lives
Todd tossed inside frantic inter-actions of transimission & gas

Todd mid-air hips planted drivers skull into the windshield

'ArGGRreh

Old-man grunted stoopidly
Vehicle stopped dead in a bush
Other truck busy gathering-the-men caught themself in a mud-pit
Only knew how to rememdy as a pack of trucks

Old-man too keen & had enough 
He opened the door & let himself roll safetly to grass

Todd took the truck hard twice
Old-man crackled in shock

!fucking-manual
!motherfucker
!gaddamngears

Todd threw his handsign
Right leg & hand moved independent

Truck lurched reverse & spun right towards his friends
Todd kept 1st gear till the house roaring in RPM

Truck of rednecks first tended to the old man 
Faimly first over vengance

Attempts to honk at Billy left unanswerd

Todd's body screamed in pain
He stopped outside the house
Flumblint like-wise as oldman

Ben took the wheel 
Jewels & Jordan hauled him into the truck-bed

Miss went work to patch up Todd & set back broken bones 
Jewels massaged Todd's wounds with a balm as he slept
Pepper-balm-sand-clay-scub 
Peppermint prepared leaves to layer afterwards 
All coated by root-oil to encase Todd in herbs
_

Todd patched up & able to rest
In the cab of the truck

All grateful to be in-doors

Jordan spoke
'Manda we drop you off
'Can we leave Todd with you

Manda kept unresponsive

Concoction blotted Todd unconciousness
Todd hauled thru Manda's window 
_

Jordan directed Ben
'Lets haul all the books now

Supermart closes in an hour
' Lets do a supply dash
' Unless yall too tired

Jewels
~ nah fk that
~ you dont wanna go
~ you sleep imma eat

Ben underestimated the quantity of books Pops stole
He first drove back to the Library to stash food
Jordan & Jewels left to filter all books into two piles

A tarp bound the buldged mass of books
_

Jordan stood outside the glassdoors of the Library

'aye
! tack ! tack ! tack

Reluctant guard eventually came to the door
!4am 
!outtahere
!libraryclosed

Same guard from the years back
He turned making his way back to his lounge

Jordan yelled back
! truck in parking-lot packed stolen-book

Guard ignored him too tired to care
An hour & the involvement of the other guard
Required to get the guard back up

'Dude
'Im fucking serious

Jordan assuring him as he opened the door
'hella-books in a truck

Guard unbought
'Yeah & Yeah fk-off dip-shit 
'library closed

Jordan caught back 
'You dont remember me? 

Gaurd now woken complete
'Oh yeah I remember you
'I remember you stole from me
'After I fed you

Guard about to snap
'dick with me today... 

Jordan speechless-from-sadness disarmed the guard
Guard subsided to follow Jordan into the lot

Guard jaw-dropped
'Shit-load-of-books

Guard looked back in friendship reknewed
Redeemed from the sharp pains of betrayal
'You just got me promoted 
'Thanks Jordan

Jordan only able to nod & let the guard get busy
Reconciliation a comptemplation to keep him the next hours
Three packed the book & sup thru the rabbit-path

Walking dark streets at a brisk
Something mechanical in his hands

After quick-glances to each direction at the corner 
He wrapped a bungee-cord around the post

Mechanical-device set on the cord to point towards the street
Lasers now scanned the intersection for traffic

Passing cars triggered a recording in a feed-alert fed via WiFi
Feed linked to a screen banded to his arm 

6 of them set up
2 minutes of estimated reaction to prepare for police 

He crossed the street to verify the device
Arm-Band lit up with his potato-quality-image
_

Warehouse at the docks sat alone
Waves crashed at the corner of the open lot in heavy sprays

Network scans had this location as a common gateway
Weeks to prepare for this night
Coiled ropes & cords flopped outside of his pack

Street front the open-lot

'find the office
'find the gateway 
'hack the gateway

'Run this cable along the gate
'Set it up to the city-utility-connector

He turned & pointed to a green box at the end of the lot 

'New cable will upgrade the connection
'Which I will slightly tax

He went forward in a rush of energy

'Keep tabs on my wrist
'When it lights up be sure 
'Nothing is missed

!show-time-muthrfkrs
!keep-it-real

Late hour kept alerts down

Man approached the fence

'Probed an oceanside-window last-week

'Security checks up a few times a night
'No system to the timing

Along the fence waited two-minutes with no feed

He only needed 20 seconds
Nike-Free soles molded to the fence
He jumped up & over in a fluid-silence 

Fences an expertise
Preferred hurdle to set tween chasers 

Movements direct & pre-planned till the base of the two-story office-building

He looked up to the window he probed last week
A loory alerted & passed 

He took off his pack & un-latched the rope
He achored one end to a thick pipe with a bowline-yosemite 

Window-ledge to a jump-hike got his arms to the ledge
An archor found to pull the line thru for the rappel down

Quiet-movements swift in a flow
Done in Qui-Gong breathing-techniques

Next feed-alert flushed him against the window

He worked open a rusty window with a thin steel piece
Just-enough for his body to slip inside 
Window shut & inside alone 

Musty-warehouse ordor with wiffs of fishy
Office-quarters sectioned into cubicles

'You expected fish-smell? 
'weird

Family-portraits & anti-stress-toys 

He took a quick inspection of the floor 
Tested the locked stairwell door

Network lines followed into a lock-closet
Whur of computers inside assured the location of the gateway-box

A pouch removed from off the pack
Only after clumsy effort the door opened

He removed a laptops from his pack
Powered-on, ready for the mission

A bogus label on the laptop
-DNS SERVER-
-KEEP ON-
-network will not work if off- 

New cat-x cable to connect both gateway-box & ISP box to the laptop

A new label placed on the company-gateway
-troubleshoot
-check DNS server on

Gateway-box had a sticker detailing the network & the Internet Serice Provider

That information configured into the laptop kernel
No need to get into the gateway-box

Man-In-The-Middle attaches between two point & pretends to each end, itself, the other end 

ISP->MitM->gateway
gateway->MitM->ISP

Ben woke from dream & wrote it down 
A photo on a clerk's desk called out to him

Family around a sign on a sandy beach
~Pilgrims Pennesula
Icon of the characteristic-coastal-bay engraved

He recognized the part of the coast
_

Dunes spring time
Jordan out snorkling with Todd

Tide nice & calm 
Skaters waited their turn on the beach
Mandarins thrown around 

! kingpin

Skaters greeted Ben
Clay Dorsey Javi & Homer

Ben joined them & caught an fruit 
He waited for Jordan & Todd to return
_

Jordan replied to Ben
'Pilgrim's Pennensula
'Never heard of it

Ben drew the shape with his fingers upon wet sand 
'Shape of the engraving
'Put it just south of the Bluff
'Right there

Jordan smirked
'no-shit-murlocks
'Well thats the answer

'Not much of a vacation spot
'In this reality

'I been out there once

'Maps read it to be a NeverLand
'Miles from no where
'Fresh spring water

'I get there eventually 
_

He paused for their meal

Clay didn't know how to place Jordan
Jewels a the bmx Legend
Ben the kingpin-hacker to which even adults admired
Todd an odd-ball

Jordan normal as any kid
Yet he always spoke to an understanding next-level-astounding

All been up since last night
Water gleamed off round shoulders

Last night they got to boasting
Pull-ups essential for upper-body-strength 

Made a competition out of it
To go to the end & see where strength settled

Jewels bored after thousands

Pull-ups best eased into over time
Stretch mandatory

Jewels told them
~  Grab arms-distance over-head
~  Lay-out abdomen 
~  Strech as bow

~  Hold elbows over-head 
~  Lean right & left

Leaping over a fence happens hourly at night
Feeder-by-turns
One launch others jumping on others-skateboard & heaving-out-krew one-at-a-time
A soar x/1 of the time
Up in the air to glide to a place
Favoring the first roll over the skate-board & helmet then pack

Each in turn first to fly
Lauched with skank-out-as-flag

Next up used skank to land & guide the rest
_ 

Jordan continued his story
Hardly a meal fruit-no-meat

'I get to Bluff
'hella-before-dusk

'Ready to bail back to the city 
'But it was a perfect place
'Set up camp & nighted deep into it

'Believe-me I could hardly sleep

'This place a Neverland
'Scheming new options excited
'Infinte places to set-up camp

'Soon as sun went down
'Buzzes filled the air

'Swarm black against black night
'Worst night of life

'Kept all night gripping my bag shut
'Bugs collided into sack all night

Jordan made a tsssss at Ben
'If you go out there
'tssss
'You deserve what you get

Todd felt a draw towards it
'We go tonight

Jordan face-back-attitude 
'Da-fk
? Only to troll

Todd reassured him
'Full moon should keep bugs-down 

Jordan palm-face 
Ben took up the challenge 

'I bet 4 supply trips
'Place a landmark-tourist-attraction

Jordan took it
'Bay took almost a century to clear out
'Logically the Bluff an ideal first-landing

'But with all the hurricanes
'Any place would have cleared out long ago

Well assured any nights suffering 
Worth four free runs

Jordan less busy yet treasured idleness

'Prob different in this existence

Clay broke in
'Dorsey you in

Dorsey declined
'Nah
'Chill at the beach
'Imma hit up Sabrina 

Clay settled it
? Out far
'You need bikes right
_

Back down to their core 5
Out to the highway 

Dismounted & walk with bikes
Hitching a ride southside-oceanside-highway

Over-sized truck pulled over
Eager to make-use-truck-bed

Scratchs & dents marks of reputation in Texas

Man at about 50 wearing a decade-old truckers-hat

'Yall take trip this late
'Not much to do out our way

Jordan replied
'There is a party 
'Southside at the bluff
'Ben-here gots a date

Jordan nudged-openly at Ben

Call getting the old man's hoot

Travel-moochers must be good company
For-karmas-sake

Old man now jeered
'Throw yall bikes in da back
'Cab big enough
'yall come inside

'Pray someone gets laid tonight
'I aint got no possibility now
'Old-hag divorced me
'Took everything but this-her-truck
'Put this fine-lass in the PreNup

His meaty-hand slaped the dash hard proving-the-rig

Jordan always kept their packs in front when hitching
A good barrier & first-contact-pad if one had to jump-out

Old man cackled-loudly the entire time 
'Any particular place on the bluff?

Ben put in
'HEB 
'we need to get a few things

Oldman parked front-the-store
'Im just around the corner
'If I see yall again 
'I pick ya up

Jordan asked crawling down the truck 
'Can we get you a 6-pack

Oldman's eyes glinted
Hooting into the night

'Moonshine keeps my figure
He didn't get this old 
Letting youngers buy him alcohol
_

Fresh supplies always hard-got
Stores hevanly place of plenty

Jewels gave props to Jordan
~ ace-hitch

Jordan smiled back
'Yeah that geezer legit 

'We can scout a base
'Camp eazy-time-to-spare

'Test out our new mega-net
_

Cashier looked upset by their selection
Obnoxious-in-cost & too-much-to-carry

Bandages behind his ears hid-tattoos
Black long hairi sleek hid-the-bandages


'Those bikes yours out front
Cashier jocked at their bags

Ben fished info out of the cashier 
'There is a party here tonight
'Pilgrims Pennesnula

Worker started-up 
Oily thin strands of hair stuck-to-his-startled-expression
He turned & looked side-to-side then to face them

'Kay first
'never mention Order matters here

'Kay idiots

He leant in closer all bro
'Tonight 

~at midnight yall
~is-gonna-be
~HELLA

Clerk sang into a low-whispered-dance

'Just keep on Jalisco
'Straight after the barrier

Deep-folds-of-skin on his neck leaked oily sweat

! it-gonna-be-tittys 

'So wassup girl 
'See-you-tonight

Worker appraised Jewels figure
Muscular legs in stockings & shorts
_

'A-holy-fk-this-wind
Jordan grunted a ways down Jalisco

Main street of the town to terminate here
At a straight-shot back to the bluff town 

Ben shouted up the bags anchored in such wind
'Better-than-bugs

Jordan yelled
'Stash sup & bikes

'Find a bush
'Eyeshot to the barrier

He pointed at the road-blocked steel arm
Gate locked off vehicles to the area

Todd chirpped 
'I wonder 
'What possibilities would have been
'Without the hitch

'So many random-events
'Create such drastic trajectories

Jewels faced Todd 
~Or they 
~Drawn to us
_

Sting of sand brought packs-up
To protect their faces

A mile & a half past barrier end of the pavement
Puddled dirt path led forward each turn more extreme

Tire treads scarred earth in deep marks & imprint
Mud pit after mud pit impossible to most vehicles

Jordan pointed to a hilltop
Lone it loomed over the bay

'Deer paths better
'Than this shit-cake-show

Miss spoke out

'This part of the bay 
'Hit-gold round the 60s
'Karma swept it all away

Gray-clay clung each step 
Streaks smeared along calves

Sanded wind no longer a blight to them
Wind blocked by the extreme up & downs of the passage

Jordan happy
'No bugs yet this path aint so bad
'Only got to carry a de-shitter-stick

Jordan gave an example
He hand to carry a stick
Scraped clay off his shoe in one movement

Jewels a nervous wreck to keep her Tome clean

Thickets dense yet always with animal-traffic
Trails connected into mazes of paths 

Hilltop visible most times

Miss stopped them with a whistle
! whiirp whiirp

Jewels set her pack down to kneel
She gathered a bush of dense aromatic-herb
Clippers & twine Jewels made four sachets

~rare
~good luck

All wore leather cords to drape sachets 
Flagged them amoung others as distinct

Bags of dried herbs & fortune charms

Todd regained strengt
'This place aint so great 
'Even-without jordans moster bugs

Toke & refreshments 
Then they mounted packs
Up a steep hillside
Thicket trucks to ladder up they climed at times

Hilltop suddenly broke-away to panorama
Dark shoreline illuminated under moon
Great waves of the ocean hurled into near-by-beachs
Outcrops of dark boulders in the distance

Jordan lamented & pointed 

'Buildings south-west 
'50 feet inland

'Off the barnacle outcropping

'You can see the straight shadows of the roofs

Ben without doubt only waiting eventuality 
'You should have known better to bet against me ole-boy
'How long you gonna survive
? if you bet against people like me

'Four runs full of
'Computer equipment & the like

They set up camp in the sunset
Stitched-together mosquito-nets

Clouds now-only-parted after sunset
After return with the supply-bags

Jewels danced around serving herself Twinkis
~ feast all now
~ HEB way back

Jordan
'Even the hike not too difficult
'This may have been our most smooth adventure yet

Jewels smacked him back the head

Jordan recoiled sorrowful
'muthrfkr-I-cursed-dam-it

Open hilltop enshrouded by the thickets 
Summit a small barren area eye-shot to beach

Camp set secluded below the sand-worn-platau
Deer trails only led a person who knew how to read deer-trails

They left camp to inspect the site

Jordan got them on a straight shot to the beach
To beach walk to the distant buildings

~Pilgrim Pene... 
A sign half-buried-by-an-accumulating dune to the side

Ben pulled it out
'Exact same logo

Jewels signed at Ben
~trippy

Miss long-since asleep in her belly
Jewels woke her up with a burt

Miss burrowed her way up
Got set up all right
Then rapt Jewels on the head

All buildings degraded from decades of age 
All heavily-boarded as to block all entrance

Ben gave-up 

'To get inside any of these required
'Half the building torn down

! vrooom vroom vrooooooooom
Trucks roared in the distance

Pack followed Ben's dream to the Bluff
Frontier of thickets & road-for-crawlers-only

Crawlers arrived loud & slow
Back up the hill before trucks neared

Hilltop at the Bluff overlooking a beach
Town named Pilgrims Pennesula
Wiped from maps

Jordan accused Miss
'Why didnt you tell us
'The wood are less than 
'the-fk-long-your-centuries

Miss 
'Hey a bet is a bet
'If you would have backed out
'You would only have lost sooner

'I like to see these things 
'Played out naturally

'You loser face is so cute Jordan

Five of them laid on belly at the lookout
In turn passing binoculars

! vroooooooom vroooooooooom 
Trucks illuminated the scene 

Tricked-to-legit-trucks caked-in-clay
Firewood netted in their beds

Each helped haul the other in a train connected by chains
Each pulled the other along in turn

They reached the beach to unlink
Dunes set up to run a lauch run

One charged fearless up the runaway and shot off the ramp
Rocks & sand sprayed as it landed then slid in a stop 
Jay-drifting it released nets archoring the truck-bed-loads
Rocketing the loose-fire-wood into an accumulated mountain

Over 100 trucks arrived
Trucks all parked neatly single file

Light flickered in blazed of enormous bonfires
Buildings all operable in service

Booths of live animals
Fortune telling & street-magicians

Merriment wasted on alcohol

One truck hauled a tethered cage
Open at the front
Jolt lauched sacrifices caged into deep-sea

First anchored-chickens then pigs then sheep
_

A great bonfire built
Rites made by robesman

Each took a vessel & a tube
Driver to suc out gas into vase
Sacrificed gas in tithes to fire-pit 

Party-a-coil around the fueled mountain 
Summons audible on winds

A dark object arose from the sea
Long form drew the LochNess dragon

Large fins steeped to the beach
It approached the erected wood

A flash of strike invisible to the hilltop
Lochness sniped half the body of a man
Which it flung up & crunched down 
In a great roar it stood upon hind legs
As it fell it bloomed a flame-lashing-as-wet-tongue
Aun hilltop shuddered as the creature landed

Fire-wood now a great blaze
LochNess returned to the deep

Aquatic-beings arose from the deep 
Dance drank & mate in merriment

LochNess head visible as distant sentinel

Tentacles foamed out at the shallows
Tentacles stretch miles from the deep abyss of ocean

Source megolithic past scape-of-view against ocean landscape
_

Esoteric Order of Dagon robesmen rose from the deep
They joined the robesman around the great fire

Encircled the crowd from ruckous into silence to chants
Odd-aquatic-hums of deep-water

Line hand-bound uncoiled towards the deep
Towards the outcrop of barnacled boulders

Men & Women & Fish-people in odd-orgy 
'Infinite tentacles medium of sexuality

Tentacle-nipples sucked bodily pleasures
A prescion to expound pleasures hundred-fold

Electric-plup-sacks-soft-yet-firm-jelly
Tingled refined levels of inticement
A prescion to expound pleasures hundred-fold

Tentacles hairy of all types & color

Hair striked as whips to naked flesh
A prescion to expound pleasures hundred-fold

Distant human forms flung up into the air upon cum
Caught and cleansed in waves by the god-like-appendages

All unkoothe
_

Green glow lit the horizon
Believed to be illuminesent algae 

In time it drifted distict & apart
A single small orb drew all in a light
Light more a fog than a billiance 

Green glow pulsated hungrily in the feast

Emerald green orb folded into golden scales 
Set top a scepter in fine-ways of master-craftsman
A hermaphadite god enlaid upon it as crest

Impossible detail opened to Todd

Miss interrupted Todds deep-scorn
'It has met you

'Once the LOCHNAR chooses
'Always it kills or submits

'Orb of the Seer
'All my life it has never called to any but he 
_

Monstrosity flailed in the high-winds hours
Tentacles fucked-all-one-to-another as puppets
Man woman tentacle intertwined to monolitic movements
Rolls of flesh in vibrating unity

Foamy-scenes of garganteuam-enviornment
Sex smell thick in the air

Ride over ll dismounted
Chain of victims sent into linked by arm

Offered to the tentacles

Lust of the tentacles gripped each in deep care 
Pulpus forms molding & humped aggressively nipples now hard knobs

Foam spouted out of the orafices
Hotly layering the naked bodys

Great shocks of electricity sparked-arcs tentacle-to-tentacle
Air filled with wails of the deep pleasure of pain

Air now all hot in steam-of-it
Sauna of sexual particles

Orb out-shone full-moon in bright-green-glow 

Each person in turn
Eminating in a frozen-form
Locked in a stasis of electricity
Awakened in full-bloom-of-lust
A freshness devoured tastily
Mouth crunched & smacked in noisy-delight

Under hot-tarps mid-day till sleep available
De-camped over a light-fire for breakfast-dinner

Miss spoke avoiding the name of it
'Knowledge only only of tales told 

'I have researched it in other existences

'Straight-line
'It can attract one directly

Todd admitted
'I saw it
'As if it in front of me
'It lit up all as a great moon 
'Beams physically drew me next to it
'I could see it closely

Miss continued loud for all to hear
'I am stranger to that glory
'view-of-godhood

'Thru it the portals will open
'It will seek us & at that time
'We need to act upon it naturally

Jordan put in as reminder
To bring them back to more important-matters
'Just hope our bikes

Jewels punched him

Jewels hailed her bike a Mary

5 Students in a library on the second floor
On a balcony overlooking the floor below

Government officals stood attent 
Children presented their impossible-discoveries 
Rings of power set in velvet boxes

Successfully tracked down against all odds
Items of legend to world-wide-press 
Attained by these children
Easily as if ring awaited them

Students honored & proud

Jordan's voice
'dont be sucker
'muthrfkrs are ganking you

Kid took the hint whole-heartily
Immediately before the boxes collected
In feint manuverd by Jordan
He re-lifted the LOCHNAR ring
From the small box as he closed the lid

Green-orb reassured his palm with warmth

Officals promptly recited their routine-disclaimer
'You will have no more dealings with these matters
'Any attempt would mean the end of your family-line

'You service to this government will not be forgotten
Military Police saluted then escorted them out briskly

Cast-shattered faces of friends
So near to be his own situation

If not for the quick odd-thought & grab

Government all on the upper-floor
A swarm in relish of the spoils

Kid quick out at bottom level

One of his mates ran up

'Hey I saw you

'You didnt give yours

Mate shoved him back towards the second-floor

'You will get all our families killed

Undaunted the kid pushed ahead 
Outmatch-mate yelling vengeful

! He took the LOCHNAR
! He took the LOCHNAR

Typically ignored by adults
Drowed in celebrations 
All who knew the call's significance
Too deep in the party to hear
-

LOCHNAR a trusted-friend after months
Kid out submersed in the streets

Rings of Power drifted as winds
Past thru owners as one grasps air

Kid recovered several of the rings
Red-gem called to him in drunken-state
Gem in possession of several thugs

Those thugs now circled the kid's krew
Krew small-looking but elite in strength

'Heard you been asking all around
'about ruby jewlery

Cocky kid provoked back
Stealing from children

? You got it

Man flashed up into a rage at the bait
Courtyard exploded full of rumble of the rough & tumble

LOCHNAR in the end subdued the thugs
Ruby jewel jumped away under a night-stand
Kid knelt down to retrieve the ruby 

Out came a little spider

'oh sir oh sir
'we serve we serve
'to you to you
'sacrifice sacrifice

Gray of hairs in semblance of royal ancestry
Majestic mane a coat of many grays

'Eight Legs Eight Legs
'Many eyes Many eyes
'All yours All yours

Kid agreed compliance

Ruby after milenium in waiting to rebuild its kingdom

! CAR

Texas flat-lands allowed plenty warning to a car approach at night
Past midnight but sweating in the humid night

Crew dove into a secluded-spot
Aided by the camo attached to their packs

Scotty tandem with his new gir Kittyl

Scotty begged that Jewels get him the bike & go out to the Garden
Jewels figured Scotty easily owed the bike 

' Bye Bye
' Sweet American Pie

Hummed in the faith, tonight the two would lose-virginty
Garden a perfect place he promised out alone cept for friends

Kitty plump-perfect-breasts
Breasts hung heavily yet perky

All under load 
Jewels had the Tome & mixtures
Firewood for Jordan
Ben had tarps & supplies,
Todd hauled-all-else using Jewel's trailer

Old one-pump-station marked the midway
Always visted on the trips to stock up

Pack past it longsince-shutdown
Familiar smell grumbled Jordan's stomach

Jordan heartless-filled Todds-trailer
Now all thankful for it

Dark clouds passed in the rapid bay-winds
Bright moon faded to eclispes of running-clouds 

Contrast empowered Jewels to embue powerful spirits
Hillside her tools laid out on the grass on a work-blanket

Soctty had all in a stir with his sweaty work
Moon high when Scotty & Kitty returned

Aura bloomed into the maturity of satisfaction
Ultimate satisfaction of naught-else-higher

Scotty iceberged the Titanic of awkward
He explained holding Kitty bashfully

'Kitty these are their states 
Scotty counted them down for her

'Brew state gave powerful dreams
'Smoke state to inspire them before journeys
'Balms to calm imflamations of deep meditations
'Edible state purged them before fast

Jordan ventured freely
'Due to the feminine-lure of drugs
'We five are often blitzed in those states

Jordan shot at Scotty
'Remember the waffle-maker

Scotty jumped on Jordan to silence him

Jewels imediately filled the vacancy next to Kitty
~ Miss go to sleep

Miss startled
'Well now her me before you give me a bed tiMe...

Jewels stuffed Miss down & into stomach
Awestruck by it Kitty looked-back-up to Jewels
Eyes big of questions & girl-talk

~ tell me

Night worn on
Jewels prepared a faggot with Kitty
Off waves of sexuality with Jewels
	weed, flowers, dried herbs
	weed, driftwood, dried-sea-plant
	honey, leaf, tabacco

Jordan's bonfire-raged till it a deep-slumber-red-coals
Tea while inhaling faggot as wind directed their way
Ben's tarp formed a Tea-Pee around the encircle fire

Hot-boxed-together around smoke 
Wind came at all directions

Vibes resonated vibrance of a spring night
Kitty blushed to awe 
State-of-being once only imagined now lived 

She took Scotty across the lake again
Cat unabashed to follow & creep from the bushs

All sexuality perked a crowded hill-top 
Kitty fk-else-fks-loud

Fingers into the balm Jewels snuck her
Spread over her nipples & then her clit

~oh the good ole it-out-in-out

She sang in a pleasure of pain
Jewels awaited it & burst into a seizsure of laughter

All went to work to maintain sanity & give privacy

Jewels out among the plants

Todd chewed a cluster of mint & cane cross-legged 
A comfortable desk kept here to write atop 
He said his night prayers to start the session

Ben on his laptop powered by local-solar-battery
He mostly first read logs

'They are the events of a system
'A cloud where one area affects rest

Much time spent generalizing logs into ambient ideas

Mountain-top in snow-caped Asia
Teen on a trail-run up the ridge

Path of it only difficult & narrow
Death consequence of mis-composure

Night put this path impassable
Aun no place to sit
Little clue on the correct path down

Slopes all drastic & divergent
Smoothe to prevent retrace on this maze

Ancestors kept this vale sacred
Journey for the boldest-of-heart

Mission to fill two buckets
All the weeks sacred supply
To present to goverment goons

Their villiage enslaved

'In this reality 
'Everyone is a slave

Sensitive to the moods of the passanger
'A lone mountain spring

'Drip by drip by drip once a week spring fills a small pool
'Large enough for these two buckets

Steel rungs of each end of the staff attached the buckets
Sturdy iron-wood-staff laid in steel & gold

This sacred relic allowed to be non-stripped
'Precious symbol of the subjection & servitude

Aun of their mountain god

'These fools know little of us
'This task used to train our hero

'One prophisized to free the people
'To never fall to the pits of the spring

'I have yet to fall in the pits all these years

Week after week trails to train him in destiny
Paid too good to stop no other bold enough
Every runner has died without exception

Passage an art
Expertised outlet out of opressed-existence

Out here naught could lord him
Out here he king of the world

World as far as eye could see
Trail could break over the ridge
Only stay in this desolate place 
King unti a meal came to mind
If another was wanted return before night came 

Todd amazed by the mastery of complex movements

Hip train warm-ups the vital key
Low to the ground mantis-style

Buckets anchor points

Movements instinctual as kung-fu master
Todd instructed to deep learning

Animal forms applicable to the present obstacle
Camel Crane Monkey Russian Bear Turtle Mouse Drunk 

Staff balanced on his neck he clasped his palms
Handsigns swiftly-executed 
Dab of precious olive-oil 

'Slavery will not break me
'Here subjucated as all

'Tho slave 
'I am your master
'Prported powerful-being
'Here with nothing-to-my-own
'Built a marvel to all eyes

'Life in pursuit
'Of this simple mastery
'When all else gone

'Tai Chi Qi Gong
'Breathe in
'keep your center
'Breathe out & move

'Extend or contract
'Breathe in & keep your center

'Staff a double-polar-end 
'Stable four vector anchor

He tightened one hand & pulled with the other
With a whip of the back, the steel ignited against a rock

Once proud boulder chipped-off a good chunk

Todd able to speak

'I am of a tribe of Corpus
'Five of us live as nomads

'A comsic deity known as Dagon
'Will consume all possibility connected

Todd felt the lump down his throat

'We are fated to lose
'Then to kill his-image before another dimension 
'Fulfilles their task to kill him

Slave responded
'Always in dealings with fate
'Correct answer always to fight fate

'The LOCHNAR has chosen you
'A power which when recieved will empower all
'Act the night of moons-green-glow

'Best make use of opportunity

Dont caught a tight terror
He said nothing of LOCHNAR

Slave continued to fill his buckets
'Time to end the summons
'I never summon & trek

Todd braved out
'I can get you over the ridge

Slave cocked back
'That idea means succed or die all-in-from-the-start
'Passangers always act too rashly

Todd promised
'There is always a trail
'One to the top of the ledge
'Climb 20 meters up the other side
'To apex of the gorge
'You will find a deer trail

Slave shot back

'There are never deer in this valley

Todd put it simply
'Then up there is your proof
'It ist he way out of the valley

? But our fore-fathers
? They can not make this journey

Todd angered him & he was dismissed
'To youth first to out-live the day
_

Late spring night on school-grounds
Patches of tables & ledges 
Lit by yellow circles of outside-lights

Rear the school at the lunch-yard
Out-of-sight of any police passing
Too large a pack to heed security-guards

Three packs joined up at the spot
A rollerblade crew invited by Scotty

Jewels stunted large
Meet Ben of the undernet

Kid set out a yarn
'hella
'Even sell KEY$ to three teachs at school

'dealers second-handers hobos 
'taco-stand ...

Kid called out 
'Troy

Troy ethralled by the spell of watching Jewels stunt around

! Jewels
! Yo that inhuman
! We cant compete 

Jewels kicked up into flip
Shrugging-shoulders
~ so 

Troy came up
Kid repeated again

'who is the weirdest client you sell a $KEY

$KEY pronounced ski

Troy twirled his long-board 
Hopped on it in nose dive
'your mom is one

Dropped a 5-stair & rolled back
Troy backed Kid off 

'No joke I was at HEB
'Your mom talked to some other lady
'Recognized me & ran over

Kid got all up on him
But he didnt let up

'like uh... ski
'She begged

'get me one 

Troy shrugged shoulders
'To couldnt say no
'To a mommy-sloppy
Kid drug Troy by the shoulder
_

Ben took up the offer to challange
Just-learned-ollie-skater quick-shoted for points

Gray-clay was an elongated trial of balance
Stable ground after the trails of the Bluff
Now felt bouncey

Ben using Tome as a ramp
Rocketed on the table

Bunny hops table-to-table 
Each table in line hit 
360 to land

A ginger-flash took him immediately
Full-body into a dense bush

Ben angry-as-hell

'Hey I tested it out
'Do you a favor

'If it can hold me
'It may hold your cave-man-ass

Too-family in a friends-situation
Jewels put the insult to use as energy

All enjoyed the scene as proud-witness
Ben squeeled over & over like a pig

Ben's embarassmant eased
All in good mood

Rollerbladers yelled

~ now lets tag-tonight
~ school forever marked to this night

Punks now demolished & tagged the place
Roller-blader freshman a verteran with a pack of cans

~ BEWARE of the Esoteric Order
A colletive work 
Fenced off preserved as art

'fk-da-police
'jen-ben-dun
(skyline of Titty-top-you-less)
(anarchy sign)
& Plenty others washed well off after a year of service
Rollerbladers caught later & injustly linked-to-all 
_

Deep night split up & regrouped at an abandoned lot
Rollerbladers promised dirt hills 

Calm pure humidity of early morn
World slowly warmed to activity

Troy lit up a Black & Mild
Tabacco cigar wood filter

Rollerblader fronted up
'We do this all the time
'Tonight was best of all

? Yall nights all like this

Jewels stood up passing the blunt
~boredom far alone
~study worse over school

Long-night of renegade-fuckery
Body battle-worn from jukes & tricks

All weary for sleep went own ways
Cops be on look-out for next days
_

Mid-day weekends before summer
Packs out still-energized from long winter months

Jewels caught breath
All else in hopes to talk to her

A crowd teleported around her
Mostly kids who only hyped 
Due to hype of other kids

Scotty & dealers under a tree in powwow
He hustled edibles-Jewels-made at a high price

Turnt on pull
Yet confident enough to transact

'Dense bro
'Sure man we 
He coughed out the Black & Mild embarassed

~cough-oh-geezzz-too-high
'Yo Erick get the wad
'Yea we get the lot

'Scotty is cool
'We can trust him

Dealer motioning it cool to break-out-out-here

Grinder-skaters set a pipe between trucks on a skateboard
Erik unscrewed pipe & popped out wads

'We hot so yall know

Dealer fished out a free nick sack & flung it at Ben

'Our product from Jamaica fresh bomb-out-thick
'Syrupy like sour-Gushers-stuffed-in-bag-hot-day
_

Posers & wanna-bes left with birds at sunset
Skate-pack stayed to get real-work-done
Grinds chip-to-shit fine-ledges of workmanship

South Side rich kids rollerbladed off a truck hauling a rail
_

Each in turn busted on the rail achored-for trick
Clays skin-glinted-in-sweat skated up to his crew not-in-line 
'aww shit man you see what I busted-out 
'540 chuck-norris to 180

'Jewels tell me you seent it
Jewels nodded leant on her bike
Rollerblader had vodka-Mtn-dew

Clay called out
'Abe 

'Get a rotation yo

Abe hooting agreeably
Pulled his sag up & flipped sack out
'Bout time son

Clay called out
? You still got grape

Abe made a bounce at it
'If there are two in a pack
'& We just smoked one
'hmmm Clay 
'you need math
'Gonna get robbed at the cornerstone

Clay unimpressed
'Hey Abe

~ Yeah

Clay blew-him-a-burd
'Watch this son 
'Imma trick this shit
'awwwww yeaaah

Jewels shot back a tip-of the head
Standing aside her bike
Her smile a big-flash-of-white

Clay distracted crashed & flipped ass-over-rail

Dealer got back in the circle ready in turn for the puff-puff-pass

'We all go to Carol
'We hit a few spots after this one
'No rent-a-cops

Abe passed Jewels the wooden-tipped cigar
Smoke let out in a thick cloud

All reeked pleasantly of tabbacoo-mellow-stench

Late of night & hungry no lunch
Clay called out more wishful than hopeful 
! A Run-Run 

Attempting to inspire a grab & dash
Old korean corner-store open down Staples 

All pretended to buy into it 
Until they got to Staples 
Their real intention revealed split ways home

Clay disappointed but expecting the reaction
'Ahhh I see how it is
'Yall aint so hard man
'Yall go home to a fridge 
~ but man
'I got to crash at Dorsey
'His place broke as fuck
'We gonna eat bread again

Dorsey shook the patch of locks back & forth
'nah nah man 
'I aint going there
Moms new boyfriend a muthrfkr

Dorsey went to Jordan
'shit Jordan hook us up with a crash
'we got no where to go near here
'Come on Jordan you know us man
Jordan knew this day would come

Jordan had built a big-ass-obstruction
Conglomeration of rusted-car-tires-sand-sack-logs

Place looks like it been there decades
That the point of the turn-off-marker 

He moved the marker every couple months to throw off the trail
.
.
.
Summer breezes of salty air 
Sweat drained-un-ending off forehead & back

Out each day undoubted joined-up other krew
Large city but local-skaters kept certain routes

Krew from Ray had a two legit youngsters
Novel technique unlocked at an early age

Jewels got jealous
A ginger-red-flame is sparky

Youngsters more fueled
Bump off the legacy of older-generation

Last spot stuck far to east-side 
Rolled up a fatty mixed by Jewels

Blunt hoped to get them back-at-it
Dumped them square there dead

Friend of guy came thru for solid
3am no where to go outside for miles

Guy like wtf called outside
Took a while to dawn on him
This mob now his problem

13 Bodies piled into a room, living-room, & garage
Dead-tired & able to pass out on anything

Pack stuck in garage around band equipment

Morn a swift-sweep
Step-dad triggered

Tired-each parted to re-sleep elsewhere
Lazy Sunday dragged into afternoon-ride
Crash-out & wake up well-after-necessary
.
.
.
Dagons Eve
Day planned to break into University Hospital 

Till then they lived as life presented
East Texas mountainous hills via hearty river

Offer on the whim readily accepted
Ride to continue North but sure a ride back an easy find

Each out on tube over vivacious water 
Down river miles thru woods & ravines

Deer Cow Bird Drunk Sheep Flags Trucks
808s at many bays

Remote strechs only made horse-back or river

Lunchtime at a particular ebb
Ebb nested by surrounding dense thicket

Jewels always gathered inland
Nightshade of the Witch bloomed-for-full-moon

Jewels picked a bud & went thru the woods
Eventually the krew discoverd her missing
Jordan tracked her down exhasperated

Lily bloomed bogs
A small valley above brought a lone knoll into view

Unreachable hilltop for any with less than her abnormal strength
Inspired the boys who hacked thru despite pain

Wiccan conjury apparent
Decades of lonliness
Decades since then

Satchets attached to trunks of trees
Idols & tokens to ward off unwelcome

Spells to lose one in insanity only wanting home
Poisonous thickets & large-maned-spiders

Wild cats hissed over harem inside a small cave
Groves of marijuana & catnip

Hut inevitable as no witchery possible to deny Jewels
Learnt of her old master now in presence of a different master

Thicket broke as if by magic & slight hump of slope
Panorama of peaceful mellow meadows of flowery greenary

Cat & Coon kittens together playful
Omen welcomed the new-comers

Cottage to the deep rear 
Great well of water out front

Blue-gray stone all overgrown with dark-greens moss & light-green vines & assorted bush
Couple of kicks of Jewels could knock the world off-course

Think oak door stubbonly flew across room
Gireplace pick scattered thrown across floor
Stone-exploded yet door held entact

Jewels neglected boys who are easily affected on shrooms
Marshmello & neon kelidoscopes thru a lost land
Transported by a unicorn guide

Smell of aromatic herbs proved beauty of the witch
Robe thin around waist & busty above

Chests still after centuries dry & preserved
Jars of what happens after centuries sealed

A snake of great lengths uncoiled from center of firepit

Jewels broomed the snake out to the meadow
Snake took to its tail
Stopped first to stare a Jewels

Crows cawed & flocks arrived
Fire ablaze & boys over-worked in spring-cleaning

Door now a sturdy work-bench for Jewels
Tome-spread-eagle packed-of-new-entries

Bowls jars kettles papers books clohes 
Seeds bound-letters preserved-herbs

Fish-bone long no.7 out & cleaned
Ink rubbed into service

Witches all drastically-different
Yet common themes astoundingly-apparent

Hut preserved only the better for the wear
Gigantic cauldron over kitchen hearth glimmered-clean

Jewels last one it after major gunk gone wore it to new-metal

Squirels Bats Birds Mice
All stole glances thru windows

A fox cawed out fondly it front the door
Jordan rewarded it onf of his a dried-fish

Great-beam of moon bore down
Bright light kept all up
Jewels a slave-master always ordered chores

Grand-old-pecan to the left cottage 
Now overtaking 3/4 of the bedroom
Braches of nuts inside the house

Rear-double-doors suited to barrow out the ashes
A great mound accumulated from all debris incinerated

An island-table boulder lay flat & stable
Molded by unknown means to have several drawers

Jordan working clearing out a rotted-cupbord
He pulled a rusted thru-pot & triggered a trap

Trapped triggered turing worn-boredom into panic
Arrows flung & whipped-roots-lashed 
All poisonous 

~FEAR WITCH
~AS SNAKE
~AFTER DEATH

Message carved over the slab that released the weapons 

Poisonous after all these decades
Minor-severe wounds to all

Jordan pissed his pants tho blood made it hard to tell
Jewels just shrugged off a few pulls thru shredded flesh

~ no panic
~ all good

Jewels in a lust as if this a long-waited-test
At her table to prepare ointment via herbs & flowers outside

Jordan asked confused
'da-fk wit her

Ben 
'Every witchs grave
'Is another witches treasure
_

Week went by comfortably

Jordan installed substantial thorn-thicketeries

Field bloomed Kung-Fu energies in Todd
Learned the lessons of the soil & rock & root of the field

Ben near insane & entirely difficult to deal with
His brain flips a bit when his power goes 0

Jewels enthusiastic outmatched Ben's fits

Dunes access to infinite transient energy
Hut staurated with passionate bloom of seasonal energies

Tabacco of this Witch's leave fused with methol 
Spirit thrived in Jewels invigorated presence

Tabacco a thick sweet cloud
Perfect for ring-wars

Third night without sleep
All left of witch consumed in mind 

Jewels summoned the Witch
Over boiled couldron of flouer & herbs

Audible-phantasm-aun-boys-heard
Wicked rasps of power 

Miss cowerd in her nest
Boys hudled together 

Boys ordered outside into the darknight
Jewels weilded a two faggots
Handed one to Jordan & Todd
~ witch bones in the well 
~ Ben help lower Jordan down

Jordan achored his rope
GriGri descented down

Yuck-of-narrowness
Yellowed bones stuck inside wall
Buried as if climbed up on own volition

Jordan barely able to kneel down to collect all the teeth
Used a make-shift broom to scrub the bottom half-heartedly
They drunk the bone-soaked-water over a week
 
A pyre erected over the mudpit in the middle of the field
Bones full of tumors now burnt to dusk 

Ashe planted in soil of the greenary
~ she not teach me
~ only  her burial
~ now gone forever

Tomes now had two sides 
Two crests of her celestial-sisters

Both passed in the manner of flame
Under full moon

Lonely hermit endowed fondness of burial of friend
_

Each with the-shits due to pecan-mostly-diet
Gone farther than possible due to Jewels

Wild herbs & pecan salads 
Jewels always kept pouches of oils & spices & herbs
She almost always made anything delicious 

Line of Felines instructed with duties
Principles passed down genereation to generation in royal line
Exteremly mixed over generations with a great many lost-cats 
Taken by owners too-close to river & forever stranded down-river

Water plants Debug here
Pick & dry & store here

Chores cats tho distracted constantly managed eventually to complete
Even if act took a week
Enlongated to serve their pride & meaningless days
.
.
.
Ride back out at the truck-bed
Guy didn't speak much
As if obligated to take them 

Dropped under hot sun 
No-where-cross-roads

Stuck 5 hours midway at the next hitch
Back in Corpus by night 

Back to the Dunes crashing waves beat welcome 
Next days only light sun & chilly relaxation

Cold wind came by & blew over
Broke skaters came by lead by Scotty

New groupies annoyed Jordan
Scotty had them go do supply-run

Four of them grateful poor-bastards from Miller High
_

Moonshine from the Bluff raved party
Drunk straight clear glowed-green-tint 

DJ Ryder pulled up 808s back truck
Standing on bed over set-up 10pm Friday  

Local krews from all regions
Skaters bladers bikers punx dealers
United where attendance defined legit
Party wild & it lasted till dawn 

Jewels spiked the drink to morph it a deep purple

Ben signed titties & had a super-star-night
Father of a worldwide network originated hometown 
USB depleted markets by this meetup alone

Party named USB 
USB or you dont get in
Each left with a bootable-unix USB

Todd & Jordan & Jewels all envious
Especially Jewels who expected to have attention

Ben dawned as a White Rabbit 
Pick-of-the-litter adored him 
Floppy-bunny-ears & floppy-titties

Dagon Eve holiday celebrated region-wide
Open-celebration at bayfront end-to-end

Pagan ritualistic sacrifice
Pigs or calves roasted
Carved as one of the members of the group 
Chosen member draped in semblance of animal

All out along the streets grill-pits flamed
Barrels mega simple traditional

A peaceful-time of brotherhoood
Harsh times blown off for flavor

Each pit the pride of a social-unit

Locals only as the food too intense for strangers
Ritual symbolism odd to a point of creepy 
_

Roads shut down into the city
Too many tourist killed by children

special
An unspoken byword 

Children packed up
Parents dare not interfere

Mobs of them swarm the streets
Multitude growth exponential

March heard produced fear
Gun locked up & cowering

Children in triumphant songs of dominance

If a child tagged you special
In the inexplicable manner of children

A cloud of children like Piranah
Waves & waves of tiny viciousness
Docile mask cast aside for this night

If you resisted it meant death
If you shot it meant you house burnt down
Ashes all you & your family

Bayside alone the safe place to gather
Taunts as if possesed by demons
Young-todler to the age of thirteen
_

After dusk in an alley
Jordan set the tarps & locks over the bikes

Rustle of chains brought the attention of a policeman
PoPo blupping demands for attention in thuggish fashion typical of police

'Hey what you doing back there
Lights hit them unepected 

On instinct they jumped a wall into a multi-level-park-lot 
A second set of cops called to close in on them thru the entrace

Four ran their asses off doomed
Sound of the squeels of tires closer & closer

They reached the top floor hoping to find an answer
Up top they found five of the skaters from Miller

'ged-outta-here
'dont get us caught

Police made money via bail after arrests

~shut tha fuck up timmy
~you got them called breaking that window

Another approached friendly
Light told him to be Shorty 
~oh shit 
~hey its Jewels

Knowledge of her prescence immediately inspired them to prove-up
No where to go & the PoPo around the corner

A freshman himself thirteen came up with the idea
PoPo got out the floor below to walk up ramp to their trapped victims

Cop cursing
'fuck quotas Gary can suck my nutts
'like his wife did when she got caught drunk-driving

Partner agreed
'These brats are gonna pay

All in one voice 10+ yelled
'SSPPPPEEEEEHHH
'SCCCCIAAALLL

Special to a cop a death-sentance
Shit-pants in a flight for life 
Fk-out-there-without-second-thought

Children are especially violent to cops
Most cops stubborn but in the end falter
_

Congradulations & aundulations in order
Memory made & enshired to be passed down generations

Ben told Shorty
'ping worth 1000x 127.0.0.1

Shorty invited
'Hey my parents have the best salooloah-dogs
'You come & tell everyone yourself
'Get hype up 

Jordan added in
'We can gonna break into Driscol

Skate crew became instantly silent
Shorty reinstated conversation
'Damn the Uni 
'Ballsy

Freshman displayed his pack of cans
'ohhh dude we could all tag it yea-ah

Dickhead from earlier smacked him in back
'You will seriously go with them
'Go let me see get on 

He fronted him
'Yeah kid think before you speak

'Alright Jewels & rejecks
'Imma hit me up them salooloah-dogs

He shouted from the otherside of the ramp entrance
'We will run by there on way back tonight
'Chill there on a 40oz
'So you just got to yell real loud
'Cuz is from Mexcio real cartel & shit
_

On the familiar ledge only traversed once
After the tree bonded to them

Bark they like
Limbs in right places

Moss cool this night as balm
Mass enough to hide & protect

Window opened easily
This security breach forgotten in the chaos 

First stop Jordan's locker at the extreme-other-end-of-school

They talked - not as quiet as thought- on the empty halls

A light sprang on & the four froze

! HEARD
! SUM
! TIN

A giant shadow clambered about
At a stairwell
Thick door raised from the stairwell

A farther voice echoed

!DAGON

! EVE

! DIM

! WIT 

Shadows warped the head as if it too tiny
A enourmous torso wearing a diapers with a gnarly hook

Shadows departed quick as they came

.
.
.
Jordan whispered angrily
'gdmit-fk-it
'told yall shut-the-fk-up

Ben brushed it off necessarily
'telling us to shut the fk up 
'is the start of all your conversation
'so it doesnt prove much

At the locker & Jordan fk-all
In a fit of elation ravished the Giant Panda Bear
Action quicker than any could turn away 

Over as quick as it begun
Jordan dusty now instead of the panda
Streams of sweat ran down painting a happy-face
Panda tied around his pack in a giant hug

Jordan said coyly in a very out-of-character-voice 
'girl i know you missed this
_

Towards the basement but first the closet
Jordan struggled this time more than at any lock-pick

Submitted to handsigns & only then able to work-it-out
Larger more rudimentary-picks used genericly

_

All-too-familiar halls
Time here only continuation
Todd mello since morn

Girl who shit-so-bad
He may have wished her dead in a curse
After the torment of a day with shit-in-shoe

Mestration blood of girls he naively thought rust
Patients blood of the hospital above

All these people tracked-down-and-killed due to his happenstance
_

Locked closet door now opened air thick-in-chemicals
Ben raised his skank over his nose

His algorithmn still proven sound 
Sure old code must have accomplished the un-crackable

Long-passage drew sweat to Ben's brow
A simple mis-step unknown could have left code dead-still-in-water

All off to themslves at other ends of the hall
Ben this anxious flipped his shit guranteed
Jordan off on the pleasure-lane of reunion

Ben reached to the end where stairs descended
Darkness felt out only a printer with an emtpy-tray

Nothing had printed & now tonight he plans over
Unable to reconfigure the a large-part-of-world-network

Ben had failed his mission to prepare
Code failed or answer thrown away
Computer labs back where they came

It would take him an hour to hack thru hardware to detect what may have went wrong

Ben flipped-his-shit
Printer flung here & there until it no-where-yet-every-where

Last landing part felt in a soft-thud
Fall softened by-layers-of-paper

Ben lifted them up
Aun dark the closet white paper revealed sane patterns
Sane patterns meant a dekription in the key
Whether or not the actual-key unkown
Key worked none-the-lest

Hundreds of them all identical
Proof after time-stemped proof

He gave each of them a stack of the papers
'Yeah you know
'Alot is on the line

'alright-fk-yall
'lets-go-im-ready

Ben passed them stacks of paper
'Guard these with your lives

Ben also gave the a USB 
Rebuild the kernels of the network
Hive-mind-survelient-system used against itself

Key allowed total interception & manipulation of traffic
Anonymous-only traffic permited in a p2p web
Kernels critical nodes no attached to the Undernet

Replacement of these nodes by manner-of-implementation-impossible
Months of rewiring & the ability to rework all computers individually
An error in implementation Ben exploited now as its rightful master

Traffic One-Time-Only-Pre-Share-Keys build anonymous tunnels
Bandwith of traffic improved 100-fold
_

Each one easily picked locks
Office doors designed to be breach-able

Network wires a simple trace to its network-box
Flashed into a unix node complete conversion

Made known to Todd of a desk
In the picture at the penthouse the LOCHNAR 

Miss instructed
'There lies a great terrror

All she would say 
Rue of fates hand dealt

They took the elevator up to the Pent-house
Ben hacked at the controls

After a drop which he swears non-leathal
Elevater ascended & opened
An enourmous suite black-hardwood-floors
Soft white sand beached a small pool of water

Penthouse ceiling opened up to the night sky
Salty winds of the ocean captures civilized

A long dark form lay on a dark-purple-boulder
Something like a tail bobbed as an iritated-cat

LOCHNAR resonated a green light to hum energy
Orb in a song of light to first startle then put creature in a jealous charge

'Miss so you have returned
'With Jewels the Treasure of Ebb-ave-lee

'We will guard skin after tonight

These screeched in a long bellow after manner of dolphin

A form on the sand once thought driftwood sprung to life
Hid mostly by sand the giant form of a 10m monster

Open penthouse gave room for charges on both-ends
Youth ready to end this ancient evil too long the villian

Creature hissed all too quick for a first-look
'Prophecy calls Jewels here for sacrifice
Hiss came from no clear direction

On the sand the creature dove the approaching pack
Certain to match its thick bones in a one-swipe-head-butt 

Frieght-train shut down 
crack-crack-crack...

Spinal columns snapped as Jewels met the collision full-force-heave
Creature now see to be made up of a tauren-like creature
Lower have a long centipide of sections of humans
Brains tucked into ribs 
Eyes replanted into shoulders
Chest to chest with the next
One long intestine connected to-top-ribcate-out-bottom-to-enter-next

Muscular arms with hands reshaped
10 fingers to fins creature a plethora

Eyes open curiously desperate to get a good-view
Todd first met the Barracuda merman
Fish from neck up
Torso-elongated as to put it on all fours for the charge

Rule one in life
Sea stick to sea-fights
Mamals stay to ground-fights

Fish quick but always pampered
Cocky off its countless feeds
Kids hardened by toil & competition

Chain-n-lock
Dazzeled-god-piece
Crow-bar 
Tome 

All laid into the Seer until sashimi layed out
Flesh rich from life lived without want

None could deny a chew-or-two
Todd clutched the scepter of the LOCHNAR
To fulfill prophecy
LOCHNAR obiedient slave

Seer lept tho now only head & spine
In last-dash to puncture a giant dark-orb which hung as centerpiece

Black-fog erupted as if it water not bound by gravity

Darkness enveloped them as a sea

Tentacled arms long & barnacled probed Jordan
Instant to snatch his arm 

Lock-n-chain impacted the arm at leverage
Thick-barnacles sliced into his skin

A ink load hit half of Todd & Jordans right-leg

Air now saturated in a darkness as a thick fog
Swift-movements dispersed it to momentary-clarity 

Jewels open-tome fan swept the air to the side

A long crusted nose exploded in mucus & blood
Star-fish fell down in a painful-rage

Behind it a host of the most awesome
As if trasnported to some malevolent-ocean-world
Monster after monster of the sea

Sight too quick for them to act
Just enough for set of gargantuan-tentacles
_

//////////////////////////////
Beast composed of a chain of torsos
Ribcage & Arms stiched in muscles as a snake
Sets upon sets of arms each with steel gloves

Bottom of ribcage wout feed out the neck connected to the next-ribcage
Skin of it a milky-softness of a new-born the rosy aspect of it unsettling

Nose grown on each shoulder
Noses sniffed in individual-character
Extermely interested in as much as dogs

Sitching required to form such a creature done with fine-precision
Arms held them securely but the heavy-metal hands out-of-situation

Each of the nails painted differently in a nacissistic finesee
Each limb of the monster grip a machine vice

Arms moved & acted independently
But the whole driven as a catepillar

Puffy-fat face done-up by too-much-makeup Creature twisted entire body in swirls
Trampled it crawled up the wall & into the dark

//////////////////////////////

All flung in different unseen-directions

Lobster-claw bit hard into Ben's thigh
Himself caught mid-air with a jump

Jules landed & jumped before the darkness returned
Tome cracked Lobster-shell in a wail & retreat

Darkness covered all aun starlight
No inch visible in thick darkness

Todd now alone with the green-glow

A voice surrounded him in the darkness
'You haunt my dreams?

'muha

'HaHAH
Breath now palpable against Todd's face

~Nightmare to nightmares
~Sacrifice of Five

~Feed

Darkness began to stir & sway 
Darkness cleared to a pack of hammer-head-sharks

Todd trusted his Passanger
He jumped to dig his god-piece into the hammer-head in leverage up
Trajection of hammer-heads now put them on a turn-about 

A darkness-blanketed-the-darkness in a forboarding pulsation-of-movement
White Noise a great cloud of tiny carnivorous fish 

Todd balled aganist a sea-plant
Gripped & pulled into the leaves

A shriek escaped him when his hairs charged
Plan shot out a electric pulse to fry the fish dead

Already dead is a much juicier choice for the hungry masses
_

Hammerhead charged as angered bulls towards Jewels
Bloody-leader knocked Jewels back to catapult Ben behind her far into the abyss

Countless movements gave way to dodge the hurled human
Ben caught this time by a big-headed-squid suction-cups ripped off-skin

Cherry red crab-spider black crustation in the sharp points of King Crab
Fangs of thick saliva glowed to reveal terribleness

In a leap it poouced on the unsuspecting squid de-skining-Ben
Massive tentacle sniped off in bunches by crab-pincers

Todd called out 
Portal back to their world thru the elevator

Ben lifeless carried to Todd 
Coupled with LOCHNAR Todd breathed life in Ben

Great gasps as a shameful whimper escaped Ben 
He embraced Todd in lost gratitude lurched to life

Awkward in front of the wicked spider crab

Light bore thru the dark mist foggy yet aquatic-forms made out
Then the arched-form-of-a-woman illuminated

Jewels stripped naked & held electrocuted
Electricity burned her freckles into red-lights

Long clear flosfloresant tentacles gripped each part of her
Mass of jellyfish synced the shocks in pulsation
Jewels lit up in a great berth of agony

Spider shot out a thick-web-line as a whip
Web striking a section of jellyfish put the entire group out-of-sync
Electrocution fumbled yet attached to Jewels
Jewels only too keen on the ways of pain
Explored all the nooks & crannys of jellyfish

Spider, Ben & Todd joined in on jellyfish-destruction
Each helped carry Jewels by a shoulder

All ignoring the giant-wicket-crab-spider
Careful not to let any interaction ruin the good-vibes

Todd got them all to resolve
'We must find Jordan
'We only leave together

Spider led them to a bubbled vent 
Vent continued thru the roof & down to school-floors

'sk-my-stinkies-yo 
Jordan said after he emerged out under the crab-shell

Jordan helped carry Jewels who passed-out after revenge
'Dont ask me how 

Two floors down they broke onto a restroom
Grateful of the clean air although it did reek of shit
Darkness a welcome clairty after the mist

A familar scuttle passed the hallway of the restroom 
Down heard in a slight resettlement

Ben too tired for this shit 
Jewels had an experimental bomb
He lit it flame exposed the creature
Top half normal until about 3 feet down

Bomb spewed out pepper-smoke into its face as mace
Eyes buldged into a visible painful reaction

Great torso double-mule-kicked
It flew into the glass shattering shards

Shards which sliced & stabbed it on the way down
Skanks up but room too small they dragged Jewels out

Now familiar with the structure they found a dummy-waiter as expected
Two at a time they hoisted down to the floor above the school

Landry-shute dropped them on close
piss shit blood semen vomit

Jordan opened up conversation
'At least it soft

Ben looked back at him
'You have a torn finger-nail stuck below your left-eye 

Todd looked out the window
'We are on the East Side
'Just-bull-rush to the west-side

Jewels out-front frieght-train

wheel-chairs-strew over
fk-the-world 
all pushed out of the way

Sirens in a blaze

One tough nurse known as Bus
Stays on the first floor for heavy-work

Jewels had one sure option
She stepped up the fire-extinguisher
Lept to other-side-of-wall
Sprung off into a full-kick-tween-shoulder-neck

Bus didn't have much of a neck
Kick slipped top to skull-crush-head

Jewels unstuck herself from mass-of-body toes-suspended all held by half a face
Accident only to be digested later 

Exit of Uni impossible from front
Doors more secure than a bank

Uni Hospital gets its money
Easy-way or hard-way

Jordan always to quick to catch
Dove in the doctor candy-stash

Late he got up to them

Todd in righteous flame burned at him
'There is no entrace to the shaft

Jordan accusative fast
'Then just make one

Jewels got the axe 
By then they were surrounded

Hopital thugs in redemption of Bus

Jordan's chain-n-lock spun to whurls
Behind Tood & Ben who backed-up Jewels 
2 axe-lengths behind

Jewels had and axe & proven to not have restraint
Short-stout-man called her bluff into a charge

Impossible to miss him but the axe have to split him 
Two as second-round filled the large hall

Jewels butt to skull & over flew
She came down axe lurched back

Two had only panic
Turing opposite direction
Each into their wall
In such a lurch to smash-into-then-back
Broken-nose to broken-nose

Jewels kicked into each chest in a stop & flip back
Bloody boulders cannonballed the mass behind

Short-man called cards on a bluff

Jewels only all in & in the sacred fire of all Ginger women everywhere
She landed from the flip careful to avoid the pools of blood

Mean-time boys in desperation to open the wall
Two others looked at the LOCHNAR sceptar

Only then did Todd realize even had the thing
Carried until now without his knowldege of picking it up
Like he entirely forgot about it

Todd now compelled to use its power
Todd began to eminate in green-glow

Jordan impatient
'WTF good a light gd-mit

Todd approached & parted the wall
Material now erased for them walk thru into the shaft to Driscol

Critters in swarms filled the sound of that shaft
One of many shafts that went as pipes
_

Inside the closet-door 
Patrols of mosters teemed

All jittery with empty-stomach
Fresh meat a savor once a decade

Patients let their savage-side take over
Mania may enter in the process of surgery-attached-assimilation

Royal-Forces to rich-kid
Human aquatic a patch-work

Appendage corrupted in a spasm of muscle over decades
Body now strunked to sustain the added-appendage

Noses like trunks with a tiny body
Legs & arms reattached to support orafices which always leaked acidic-mucus

Monster in a lumber towards them

Jordan in a moan
'fk-all-holy
'three floors of this shit

Lumber of redistributed organism sickened sanity

!!! POW

Top-left-chunck-of-nose obliterated in a red puff
A hairy clump smacked the floor in fron of them

A man down the hall dragged himself with his only arm
His legs chewed off all wounds seared.

He crawled in an escape in complete shock
'we come for you
'to take & lock-up

'monsters hit the main group
'when they too far

'i went in with the rest 
'to save my cousin

Guy baggled on helpless

He had one bullet left
They chould not help him so they just left

Bloody trails led to a room
Motion a clusterfk of smacks & breakage

Five crossed it very carefully
Monsters unintelligble-one-from-other busy

Bodies all in different stages of carnage
Crawler had snuck from here but there is no escape

Flesh chewed or carefully-slices to reattach to themself
A Nose front a pile of fingers
Hands busy attaching them in a train to support the front
_

Only blood streaks until the first floor
Dead monsters & cartel after hard-won-battle 

Clean up krew returning with orders to secure a hallway window
Both groups met at a corner-face-smash

Scoritaur upright head but horizantal torso
Spine to ass-hole connected into a mega-spine
Tip a wicked-bone worn into an axe

Backed off & then snaped back-bone
Backbone snared by a chain
Lock end caught something in a heave he scrunched it
Todd lauched Ben up who came down in a double-stop

Spinal columns exploded-out
Bones now protruding where monster-faces-were

Tail end un-aware until it too late
Jewels Tome held in a twirly full-body-swing
Splattered a bulbous creature against lockers
Mess after-wards could honestly have been anything

Distraction blew off the heads of the rest
Cartel armed with guns they spotted

Julio came up to them 
A expression of shock
Whatever in the past clearly of no import
'chinga-tu-madre-whey
'more these assholes
! desde-alla no podemos salir
Mortally wounded as the others & hysterical

Dead vatos both a blessing & a curse
Countless monsters now dead yet a swarm stirred
Latent pools of energy pooled by containment unleashed

Unleashed hordes now bounded out & up hospital floors
_

Todd remebered the dark visage had whispered
'more fate demands you to answer me
'fate will deman me to answer you

Caught quick as humans are weak
Scepter taken & able to see clear

Friends all surrounded despite Jordan's ingenuity
Allowed to take friends & leave thru a specific portal
Given back the sceptar

Fuzzed off as a high 
Low came just after long-glide

Vessel carried by his friends until this moment
Todd handsign to regain complete focus

Todd took the time to explain this
Without guiding principles dilemnas 

Group yet to give an answer
Rumbles of earth-quakes shuddered the bay

Death of the Seer
Staff long-since-dead
Monsters released from cell
Barrier broken in a damn

Aun Jewels stampeded-to-death if they not stay there 
Restroom with the longlasting remains of Julio & Emilio

Vent of First Communication exploded into Todd's hands as a relic
Creatures single-vision-escape by-passed them hid in the stalla

Todd knew certain they alone released the seed of Dagon to be spread to the world
Schrodinger Cat tho intelligent & insipid must put a father where there is offspring 

LOCHNAR a deep well of cosmic energy emitted by a soul or star
Todd a vessel chosen to breach barrier

Guiltless as he did not control his actions for some time
Todd to become Dagon egg to hatch in time as cosmic-portal
Entity to jump thru to birth vessel in this reality 
_

Jordan tied Julio & Emilio together around Jewels
They smacked each other in unwanted kisses
But the only buffers to full-frontals at the moment

Entire section of the building obliterated
Acidic silme as lava
Shoes half-melted to an unstoppable corrosion 

Made their way to industrial
If they helped everyone needed they'd gotten-no-where

No to survive at times
It is only certain few with ability
Honor to a debt to live-for-all

By time they able to save someone
Out in industry all still vacant 
_

In war men face themselves as monsters
Now man faced a monster without perception
Horror an infinite question of pain in reality

LochNess out to skyline burned-down any govt-weapon
Flame a demonic corrosion unlike fire known

Tentacles streched miles thru pipes over streets
Intelligent eyed appendages struck in percisions of muscles past milenium
_

Two types of monsters prodominant
WereFishes & Companies

WereFish
Aquatic-material converted onto human-creatures

Company
Human-material converted onto an aquatic creature
No longer human only a human appendage in a great-machine
Mechanical nodes to a conglomerate government

Loved ones ficious beasts
Monstrosities stop dead hearts

Humans splayed then stuck spine
Anesthesia put people high as fk

Disassemled carefully craftsman
Attached to monster at workbench 
Would work over an emotional victim

Laugh Cry Moan
whatever you wanted
Only at a hysteria
Anesethesia past pain

Visible fissures opened
Portals lead thru 

Entire bay infected
Friends devoured at best
Seen in operation at worst
_

Monsters + Conversions 
Exponetial growth fed more portals 
.
.
.
Ninjas on mission to find princess
Attracted by the smoke-bomb skills of Jewels 

Fight at what the world decided containment-only
Ignore a small wound in prayer it all go away

People still went there day-to-day for work
9-5 Time of day fish sleep & safe until 8

Companies now setteled on some land 
Mind at the new homestead to build their village

Areas easily avoided as neither wanted interaction
Shame of seeing a relative stressful for-entire-schedule

Dive to jump thru fissures
Portals empowered on lunar cycle
30 day limits set on treasure-hunt

Portals to worlds sacked by Dagon
Fish out spoils for the taking
