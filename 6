Todd had to confront her

'Jules you spend obsessive amounts of time
'In the Hut

'Id swear the state of it all
'Looks better than it was before

She did not respond
Her dedication unwavered

'You are become'n her

'She was a master of her arts
'No matter her choices in life
Jules defended 

'If I could give the dedication
'She strove in life

Todd inturrupted
'By the fruit
'You will know them

'Yes she has taught all of us much
'But there are
'Lines she overlooked
'That in order for us all
'To stay synced
'We must never cross

Jules looked down
On her work from the day

The rats need more room
So she had extracted certain organs
Fiercely to make the time

Several days preparation
Now destroyed by Todd's interference

'Listen Todd
'We are all too connected
'To ever allow divisions

Todd was brushed out
The experiment
May still have some value
