# BOOK_II : CHAPTER ONE 
##########################################3
I, Jordan now write after
The manner of Todd to continue Legacy

On the beach 
Marooned for years

Heart of Ben's network
Center of over-grown-park

Jewels & Jordan spent
Secluded a year

Monthly trips to 
The Garden

Even less words said between
Ben's access simple after time

Jordan & Jewels 
Ran into a sucpicious-pack

Used the regional-survelience 
Caught anomalies to betray a path

Jewels had excelled on her own
In the manufacture of plant-bombs
Smoke & crackles & toxic-gas

They set up the ambush

Anomaly first traced prior
By a small ripple
Only by accident was it noticeable

Jordan stoned infront of the screen
The matrix-glitched to a clear image 

Jewels tome a wall
Leather-pages thick
Iron-bands & dried-oak

Jordan himself hid
To the shadows to
Out-6-flank

Time to practice
Rope Knot Jitsu
.
.
.
Clockwork a soft-patters
Then a flash of shadow
Flip over wall & onto ground
Right in scope of Jordans-rope

Ninja quick-drew only not fast enough
Jordan had his ankle 
He caribeanered the apline & running-bowline

He swung down from high
Veer'n right for him

Metal glinted of blade
'Ninja not fk-n round Jewels

Ninja caught off guard 
Jewels emerged at 6

She tossed the smoke-bomb
& Instictively reshielded

Twat-Twat-Twak
To Jewels more of a 
Gong-Gong-Gong
Weight knocked her back

Smoke enveloped the area
Jordan now dropped down
At a safe trajectory

Easy tho blind the throw would be
Ninja unable to prevent technique

'Calm down fk-face
'We aint gonna hurt-ya

'Only want some questions
'Hell you are trespassing Jap

Jordan pointed out dangerously
As the ninja in clutches accepted

'I come here
'Not as national enemy
'But of one of Dagon

Jewels jumped up
'You know of Dagon?

Ninja now more perked
Tho suffocating in cloud

Jordan ascended & let down the ankle-anchor
~Your Good

Tho enemies-of-their-states
The ninja let go immediately

New respect found his voice
'Our seers & our nation
'Now bow to this new being

Jewels elaborated
(jordan-dubbed like a rapper trying to capture attiude)
'Dagon is not a being yet
'But will only be an impossible being
'He has passed thru once to devour
'We must eradicate the spore-clones
'Before he passes back

Enlighted by the intelligence
Ninja let himself relax composure

'This technique is very good
'You are elites sent by your government to intercept us

Jordan shot back
'Just Texas locals
Jordan redrew his cord

The ninja jumped out heartily
'Your smoke technique is precious
'Our clan will trade you 
'In exchange to greatly improve his technique 

Jordan hit un-expected & regained
'Thot ya-understood it unavoidable

Ninja bowed head in respect
'Only in that tech as ours
'Would speed up the trap
'Thousands-times-faster
'Our clan has a specialist

'Let us meet
'Two weeks from now

Jewels agreed with a
Middle-finger & Dagon-handsign
'Midnight abandoned air strip
'To the north of the city

Ninja bowed his head
& Continued on

'I will be beaten
'For my time lost
'Worth it for new-friends
.
.
.
Jordan was itched-at
What earlier the ninja said
Could correct his technique
'Thousand-times
'Please 
Jordan sqwaked at Jewels

'she-it
'I prefer being stronger
'rather than faster
'Thousand-times-over
.
.
.
Jewels & Jordan
Came fresh from The Garden
To the abandoned air-strip

Both parties decided to bear gifts
Lightless bikes aproached the presence
Of two lone-standing ninja

On que of them dismounting
Ninja encircled them

Tallest of the lone-standing ninja
'Your trust will be held sacred
'Lord of the ||||||||| clan greets you

Jewels casual set the presents aside bluntly
Not at once bothered or afraid

Lord struck 
she-cant-be-serious
As the Texans here say
Now dawned what that meant

Clan of twenty dark individuals
Enclosed the meeting

Dismask & greet
They in line
Would dis-mask & bow

|||||||
each in-turn-tune grunted

His presence she could feel
As it slowly approached

Jewels knew & only
Awaited unviel

Takashi
He arose
Traps supported thick head
Two hundred kilos of broad-man

Slanted-eyes-sharly-deep
Ancient-in-wisdoms-as-crow

Tan-yellow-glow of skin
Jewels signed her name
Softly on his cheek as he bowed

The rest is all lame-romance
That has no part in this story
I feel this is always
What Todd would have wanted

Pray Jewels makes a diary
Caz I sure-as-shit-sticks
Wont write more about it

Lord then bowed
Revealing an ancient face
'Maru

'When ||||| told us 
'After we had well-beaten-him
'All near felt bad for the punishment

Crowd of them all laughed-geniuinely-lightened
'Come show us one of those bombs
'|||||| cried blue-smile a week

'~~~Daymn
The soft voice of a boy said

Had Jordan's respect & approval
It was the one Jordan thot
Was a odd-size to have
As if only to fit in small-spaces

Jewels signed in simple-international
Clan all had prepared vigorously

~pleased-to-meet-you-as-well
~let us start a tea & blunt

Jordan on que broke out prepared-wood
Attached from his bike 

Astonished as these were plains
No would to be had upon thought 

More-so the hatchet Jordan produced
Spax the hatchet

He drew kindle & logs from one
Laid the other across & Staked an Iron Spike

When he opened the tea sack & marijuana
Takashi moved in
'Let us bond with of gift of ours
Jewels accepted the sack & Jordan sulkily took it

Beaten & defeated obviously what already never-was
Small boy seemed to look at him in a sad empathy

Takashi stood at Jewels side always
From that point on & forth

Jewels opened one of her bikes thatched-baskets
Takashi took the items & set them front all round fire

All enclosed to inhale the smoke of Jewels-herbs & their weed
Rough yet thin sacks of ground-dehydrated fluff

Cat-skin-only-leather dried-out around tail-wick
There still was a resivour of skins from Todd's revenge
Not to mention the natural-died onces accumulating
Four paws tie-point-togther 
Out mouth dried-soaked-tail-wick

~smoke
	~cloud
~pepper
	~blind
~smoke-pepper-lemon
	~gas out
~hot-pepper-sparks
	~harsh-blind

30 Sacks of varying size laid down
Kittens can't all withstand life

Maru stood spoke up above the lifted-gathering
'You technique was designed but lost by us
'This same clan before you today
'You now re-endow heritage 

Jordan & Jewels stood respectfully & bowed
||| |||||| | || |||| ||| |||| ||||
~An honor to rendow the technique

All struck as if seen ghost-&-proved-it
Exchange in code of their most sacred-inner-speak

Jewels remained standing handsign-rotations
To speak to all
~dreams connect existences
~branches-of-each-entangled-soul

~We summon & parlor discretely
~A manner in which technique is shared
~In an ethereal manner that connects power to us all
~Unite possibilities to single-minded-purpose

Their ritual of anoit of soul-awakened states
This a branch new-exclusive-powerful as clan in waves would echo-understanding
.
.
.
Groggy early-morn party till dawn & hour sleep-reverance
Early morn traffic yet to appear they sorted up
& Began a normal day of training
Above & beyond which Jewels & Jordan thought possible

Maru understanding there after he dispappeared to sleep mid-night
His rituals all long-since-completed
'Here as an enemy of the state we keep sharp
'Tho we owe it no harm we must not be dull

Jewels & Jordan awknowledged respect

Maru continued
'Far from the love of home
'Natural work finds place
.
.
.
Takashi aside with Jordan
'This is our line
Jordan was given a box mechanism

Takashi pulled out the line to Kunai-stake it as a trap
~Pull here upon the GriGri

The cord snapped back
Kunai enjected Straight up 30ft to fall on point below

~We all use GriGri belt-buckles on our harness belts
Ninja lifted his skirt to show harnesslike understructure

A ninja came with tea & breakfast-burito
~All japan will adopt the Texas-Egg-Burito

Ninjas roamed with month's supply at most
They would piece-by-piece moves the supplies forward

Jordan was busy with the GriGri cam
This technique would bring him next-level
True ||||||| did not offend him before
.
.
.
Maru continued with Jewels
Clan all in their doings
Unaffected by the rawkas night

'Dreams our links together as a net
'Benefits though its knoweldge unknown

'You have hacked that system to great-powers

Jewels stiff to the compliment in a sorrow apparent but not awknowldged

Mauru back to business
'You life reknewed our clan's technique
'You both are heroes & will always find home in us

Jewels blushed at he compliment
Maru extended his arm with embalmed bandange
'Chi energy of your herbs very potent
'In Japan your skill will be reveered 

Jewels further flattered
'Company is very much appreciated
'Your clan society very pleasant 

Maru finished
'Yes it wears smoother harder the time

'& Takashi to be so is of great gossip

Now Jewels definitely blushed
'He as never taken to anyone
| ||| || |||||| |||||||
'He-who-waits-for-mountain

Jewels now eager for business
~His soul glimmers pure as a diamond

Settled respect fell enlighted on his narrow eyes
Accentuated by the defined lines of his eyeballs

'Our mission is on the same
'Golden road of your mission

Jewels walked about in a pace
~The regions network is in control of us
~It is private at we have great power over it
~We have power over the Lair

~Once we destroy it
~We can portal to other ends
~To destroy spwan after spawn of Dagon

Maru timid
~What can we do against a god

Jewels affirmed him
~Stars shine of all 

They began their battle-plan
With a large blanket & tokens to build & manuver situations

Noon called them to the hammocks prepared in the thickets
.

# BOOK_II : CHAPTER TWO
##########################################
So necessary the need they spent the winter months at the beach
Off messanger & messanger

Maru explained
'We rotate 
'Trip-here-rest-month-Solo-return 
'Takashi has requested permenance

'All are becoming rich
'Returning to spread your technique
'All from that will owe your group

Maru understood without explantion
Pain that resonates as deep bells
Upon those who have lost comrades
.
.
.
Takashi instructed Jewels in Kung-Fu daily
Passangers crowed silent watching

Chi & manipulation of other Chi
Jewels great strenth now refined

'You train day in day out
'Extraordinary
'Masters themselfs inbearable 

Jewels sorrowful the rest of the day
.
.
.
Days were short
Train Breakfast
Train Dinner
Ten hours till tea-time & sleep
1/3 only awake
.
.
.
A ninja strikes 
Swarm of individuals
Infested Shadows

Co-ordinated with freq-cmds
Jewels now more expressive than any on the comm

Hope of tongue only shamefully remebered
Knowing Miss much more valuable than voice

Jewels was now the line-backer 
Two scout for Jewels to tank
As the anchor/pivot of the line-behind

The clan took immeditely to the bombs
Now each ahead of Jewels so latent-its-energy

The distance of their single-strike-zone
Ninja scouts & pin-points attack-vectors

Ninjas line up & execute all on instant

On the hill of the dunes they built a base in the earth
Scope only & lonely station of one in relief only-action

This point so needed to be watched

A ninja would inject deep
Upon spot smoke-bomb & disappear easily
Smoke immediately a symbol
If only the sight but mostly the pepper smell

Other scout & line-backer 
Head immeadiately to help
In an action more quicker

That is why they all dress the same
One relieve other without their change of identity by spotters 
.
.
.
There were chronic sacrifices at the bay
Experience easily gained as their skill
Drastically out-weigh any opponent as-of-yet

Action must be exactly instinctual
In a critical counter reaction

Correct response keen automatic
Veteran to an encounter enemy fresh-oblivious
.
.
.
EOoD began to militarize the area
An open move to alarm the world

Ninjas in this were successful
Honorable to only glory in this
As partner with Texas

Gods demanded none-the-less
Order fighting on two fronts
Itself & Rebellion

Factory of sacrifices were found
Some rooster would lord a coop

Portals opened would be known first
Always by the Rebellion
Suvelience exploited against itself
.
.
.
Now with two teams
US Marine & Royal Forces

They headed as a third
To aid in an ancient war

By attacking from portals

Humanity the obvious
Fishy order had a smell only obnoqious
Or so they had been led to believe

Marines backed up the Royals
Royals directed by Maru
.
.
.
Jewels in many universes 
Enriched by professional 
BMX champion

You only get how that obvious
From been in combat with her

Jewels & Takashi
Her able to carry his weight
Armored as weighted-mace
To the arm of Jewels
Xena Warrior Princess

Jordan never bedazzeled as much
Few forgoten songs were sang of him
Always only an attachment of theirs
.
.
.

# BOOK_2 Chapter A 
##########################################
On que portals would waken near the bay
More inland tho the Order only frequented ones over the ocean

Jewels led them by bike using Jordans technique to hide under tarp
They trained supplies for two weeks to stash at their base

After a few days they spotted the first
One would glow in purplish haze

Naga then emerged
Shark-Octo-Hammer-Whale-Squid
Gators the worst of all

Over the next week
Order sacrifced hourly

Maru
'We know nothing of portals
'Clear one in use
'Enter three next side

Jordan Jewels & Takashi
|||||| boy demanded to go
Ruse for him to get inexperienced

Pack of them capable
Endowed by Fates-Auroas

They had their packs
Takashi an oxe

Internal & External packs
Will observe three days
In the shadows to help

Return via the same portal
Determine if ununsed-portals safe

An Octopus alone guarded the portal
It was night & his eyes dark-accustomed
Ink sacks were full & charged
His fk-feed last night a beauty
Suction-cups titilizing-to-the-memory

~THWAK

Octo dove cover
Moments passed

Enemy had advantage
Defend & Portal out if too dangerous

! TWANG
Trap set on the Octo
His main body trapped

But only to a location
His tentacles each free

~THWAK ...
Repeated the net of kunai-line-anchors

Maru spoke
~You will inform us 
~Or you end your-life
~Baked into a treat in the sun
~A declicacy for us especially

Maru neared in
Octo spat ink
Quicker than a gunshot
Maru faster with the staff
Iron bands withstood a jet
If would had been shattered

~THWAK
~THWAK
~THWAK

Front tentacles staked to the ground
! HISSSSSSSSS

'If thse do not return
'We will bake you till then
'& Eat you gratefully with wine-sauce

'If you aide us you will be freed

Octo resilient

Maru motined Go

Jordan lept thru the portal

Jewels too anxious followed
Takashi & boy without hesitation
.
.
,
Clan led a containment strat by boxing-in
Their own entraces into the portals far-zoned
Distance from the Core 8-meters-per-meter-here 
Each portal powered finite of energy
.
.
.
Deep Sea Neaseua
As if an garganutan wavy
Soul only in dazed stupor-afloat

Reality wavered until still
As if the difference between
Wakefulness & sleep 

This was the new world
Ancient Japan

They were on a hill
The shrine above a city
Backed by a Jungle

A seasonal spring ran weakly
Sky above bright in moon

Jordan ascended up a mount-point
His binoculars eyed the largest mountain to the rear
Set his compass
Gri-Gri dropped, packed the rope 

Boy busy inspecting trees
He would make a delicate mark somewhere difficult to find

Hot & tired from the summer night
Around dawn they reached a suitable camp

Cover was built on the look-out tree
Trail, river & distant town in view

Jordan perched atop in a secured hammock
Harness kept him secure all night

Jewels & Takashi made a quick rabbit trail
To make themselves busy midst a thicket-growth
.
.
.
Only fire from the stove was permited
The boy helped with the fire set-up

Jordan could never get a tree-station proving to any worth
The boy touched Jordans hand affectionate

! WTF
Jordan revolted back

Un-invited the boy took off his shirt
Then unbelted large volumous titties

~I am princess of the tribe over the clan
~I choose to be with you Jordan of Texas

Tit-tastic-fun-bags swept away
All manner-of-awkward-ness for mating

Hammock-Tree-Ground-Spring-Pool
Till noon Jordan unleashed appetite

Princess clung to him affectionately
Skin on skin in the nakedness of mankind

You were always so handsome
Like a lost dog looking for a home

Jordan looked back to her
Settled eyes of satisfaction
'Will you be that home

She rolled on top
Head breathing over his chest
Hammock sway with high-winds

Heavy clouds now overthem in seclusion from the sun
,
,
,
First two days past in fuck
Jewels shit-herself-in-shock
Till she saw the curves herself
.
.
.
Their mission to wait & observe
Jordan observed plenty while able
To be young, dumb & full-of-cum
.
.
.
Nearest trail was frequented as a typical outskirts trail
Adultery, sneaking, & thugs mostly

Town bustled loudly as a cross-roads more than industry
Such places less contained to keep Jordan always watching

Location held secure with no near-by passers in sound
Princess looked at him charmed by the thought

Men come in a shapes & abilities
This one shone above with purity
Single-minded-ness & intelligence
.
.
.
On the third night a portal opened in vision
Unable to pass ahead as it was in-between
Mission waited patiently in the bushes

A man stumbled thru
He wore a Circle-K shirt
Jordan recognized him from the Downtown store

Unexpected from the shadows immerged beastly-fish
Before a scream a dart of a creature latched onto his throat

All sure that the place was vacant
Less caution would have led them in the center surrounded

The feed took nearly an hour
Parts all dragged off leaving no trace

Jewels signed
~To return here
~Would prove the next stage

Jewels went first
Suffered yet returned immediately

She vomited
~It returns us to North Beach
~On the other end of the bay
~In the marshlands

After a few hours Jewels had to suffer a third time
.
.
.
The Octo decided smartly to co-operate
Jordan confirmed over the network

Four of them took the bus back to the Bay
Their mission would allow the a weeks rest
.
.
.
Maru explained
'Portals bloom from anomalies caused by a nearby source
'Regions lead to portals of different existence
'The map is marked by portals & locations

'Jewels, Jordan, Takashi, ||||| & ||
'You are team Alpha
'Return via the North Beach Marshes
'Secure that area our scout reports it as a dump of sacrifices

Team had their orders and were out
Mission find the cult & eradicate 
Take back the head of the leader & his relic

New-addition the new-arrival
His build strong & his technique never observed in training
He was totally silent & only followed-orders
Royal Elite charged with the protect of the Princess
Hostile to Jordan in every possibilty 

A suitable-secluded portal was found to the south-end
Jewels would enter-first Zippo in hand with bomb

Wobbled to existence with tome shielded over her
Smoke spurt out enveloping all with Jewels protected by face-mask

Dense-Fog allowed them all cover to recouperate
Bomb died out & Jewels readied her Tome
In on fast swoosh she laid bare the air ahead

Only the calm-dead of early morn
Mountain easily found & they rested in camp at noon

|| secluded & set-traps with no sleep 
Morn greeted Jordan with admiration of surpise

Locations minute were not left unattended
They would rest all day & inspect town at night
.
.
.
Houses of the Order always had a smell to them
Jordan followed his nose & within the first hour found

A center-section of the city held the blocks
A fishmarket below but higher levels rose small-windows

Jordan ran the line with help of the Princess
To the direction of the mountain laid the line

Things slopped out wetly in the dark
They crept thru smoothly

Up stairs to higher floors
Jordan spotted thru windows outside
Princess spotted for him eyes on the town
