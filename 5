They slept
Herbal brew over
Pit in the center

Bedding pack to the left
Bike to the right
Weapon always on waist

These partitions were chalked out
Into a Gram that bound their quantum coefficents

Jules made a pepper smoke
They all learned from the witch
Alway wear a skank like Jules
It could kill weak lungs

The explosion of this smoke
Gave an even stronger positive obfuscation
Blind'n the eyes in onion
Grown in soil of certain mixtures

Normally this was done
The potion a ball
Burst'd at a direction
Bat'd by the bike
.
.
.
Jules afforded them gear
All preferred the child sizes
The minimal coverage allows complete manuverability

They still all looked patchworked suited up
As if they were on a race
.
