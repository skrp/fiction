# CEMETERY DRIVE

Expand'n urban areas
Breached every boundary

Long lost & tucked away
Crevices exposed

Down a wooded dirt path
Miles to the ridge

Where only boys
With dogs go

Lie a ridgeside 
Cemetery

Woods condense'n 
To thicket more & more

The closer boy 
& Dog approached 


Under large trees 
Beneath emense ferns 

Momuments to
An ancient strength 

Lost since lost

A beohemoth that takes breath
From all who look upon it

Power pooled 
As-if from souls
Of the dead

Tombstones worn smooth
Ground immaculate

Day after day
This remote place
Called out
To the boy & his dog

World around consumed
By greedy gods
Of Capitilism

Dogs must be on leash
& Only cross here
C
oncrete regulations clutched 
All in grasps


Sit'n on hump 
Of grassy knoll

Worn sleepily tired
From a hot days journey

The caretaker 
Came into view

Tall & Ancient 
As the trees
Of the place

The man loomed
Over a broom

The boy approached from behind
' Is it all right that I come here 
' So often?

The caretaker turnt from his work
His elderly eyes took him in 
With compassionante consideration

But before word was spoken
His dog barked alarmed 

The echoes came from a distance source
The boy took off without second thought

Towards the echoes in a fluster
Leave'n the question unanswered 

On & On he ran 
Till his shirt stuck
To his body in sweat
The barks further & further

Open slopes
Up & Down

Rarely under shade
To keep off the noon sun

# MOSLEUMS #########################
 
A center hill rose
Higher & higher at every slope

The mound hosted great mosleums
From it all
Tombstones spread
Out in all directions

Great locks all secured 
In the keyless fashion of the dead

He had never been this deep into the cememtary
But he had no consideration of curiosities

At the center of where all else seemed to serve
Loomed a mosleum unquestionably the greatest

Its two great metal doors flung open
The echoes of the dog resonat'n
From in between them

Ancient & gothic structure 
Streaked with the black tears of time

Without hesitation 
The boy chased 
Distant echoes

Inside beams of colored light 
From high arced windows shown down

A large circular stone gate
Allowed entrance to
A stairwell 
Descended to blackness

To cold depths in total black
The walls of earthen make
The stone stairs concaved with use

His sense of touch
Only gained enviornment information

Countless acts of faith
As he took hurried steps
Each follow'n another

Hunger ate at the boy
Thirst froze to a chill

Unintelligble hours passed 
Barks now possible imaginations

A step took him down
Hurt & tumbled he finally stop'd

There in prostrated pain
He closed his eyes & slept

# DEPTHS #########################

The boy woke 
To unbearable silence

The dog wouldn't have passed him
The only option was to proceed

Hunger nor cold bothered him
The daze of exhaustion 
Bore him relief of all pain

Fever took him 
He laid down & slept again

He woke in a sweat alarmed
A fever this deep would likely kill him

Teary eyes burned 
As the boy wept uncontrollably
To fall again to sleep

The boy woke to find 
That the outline of stairs 
Slightly outlined from black

Enlive'd & rested
He rushed down the stairs
At a confident pace

The light grew with the hours
Until deeper the source 
Of the light was discovered

Moss all around
Deeper depths made 
It more luminecient

He was able to see clearly
Humid air drenched dry lungs

The stones were warmer
The heat & sweat
Not caused by fever

The boy stripped off
The wet shirt

But enlighted by 
Weight of sickness 
Lifted from his mind
He even let a few laughs out

Roots in earthen walls 
Dangl'n down in inexplicable ways

Like the thick smokey way of a costal fog
The dank mustiness of the air was now gone

The handle of a casket
Embeded in the earthen walls
Still glimmered for attention
The boy gave it a pull

The handle extended out like a door
A wrapped mummy

The mumified arms
Crossed a sword 
At the breast

The boy took by hilt 
The sword from scabbard

The dusty & cobwebbed hilt 
That drag of fine crafted metal
As the sword left the sheath
A pure clear ring as a crystal glass

The metal of the blade blue
Reflected brilliantly the light

The boy pushed the casket back respectfully
Then descended the last of the steps
Into more mossy grounds

##############################################
# WORLD OF THE DEAD

The low ceiling dangled roots
Closer now to the roots he could see

Little hairs of the rootlike-plants
Emitted the dust that feel like feathers to the ground

To assimilate with the mass of fog
The dust the glow
In nightly green blue & purples

Gusts blew from the end of the tunnel
In the refreshing assurace of a way out

At the tunnel & boy 
Immediately broke
Into an open area 

Open prarie fields
Encapsulated by rock dome

Moss & Vines
Draped down in beards

Dust'n light
Over all in glow

Stars rained down
Illuminate'n all

The plants waterfilled
Cross between cactus & orange

Massive tangaries
Like hives harvested
Hummingbirds & bats

The edge of the sword
Passed thru all heedless

Sharp define'n paths
To that from it
The mouth of the stairwell

Soon he was able
To see the path
His dog left

# ################################

Plants glowed in the moist way of deep ocean foliage
Gentle & soft as the skin of an inocent babe unbleach from sunrays

The size of the dome
Larger than mountain valleys

Of the stairwell mouth
From the point of it
The mount of the stairs its pinnacle

Trunks of coral
Spread up & flailed out

To that it appeared
Exactly as a tree

The sword
Heavy in his arm
Strained his muscles already

But the strain 
Gave him confindence

To continue on the mysertious path
Track'n his dog down with reknewed hope

# ############################################
Down the stairwell he had much time to think
Of what in life is worth put'n all on the line

He conintued because he knew
This was the only path he could take

The air was humid to the point
He needed to pee every hour

The rocks had the similarity of barnacles
Organisms cultivated the stone as homes
They protrudded out like great boulders
Infested with swarms of things
That bit & stung

Mammilian like insects
As if these the link
Between animal & insect
+
+
+
Large bulbous fruit
Hanged everywhere gratuitously

Skin so thin the bitter
Complemented the taste of the juice

The richness of the juice
Complex & energize'n

The grounds were not like
Cultured forests of the surface
Where all life found inter-twined for resources

All life here kept respecatble 
To the other plant

The moss the lower layer
From which all else seemed to favor

Here moss enchanced
The plants it made home
+
+
+
Hummingbirds
Quick & Glowed
Always of the juice
That stained neon light

So as to appear as the fruit
Until they in instant flew off

The boy now in his underwear
His clothes in a bundle around his back

Each plant he had seen
Was unique as if it belonged to no species

#############
# INHABITANTS

The boy called out to his dog
Sound seemed sucked away

The boy became too sleepy to stand 
Drunken vision creeped unsuspect'n on him 

Until it was a wave already set
Himself at the crest already destined
To crash deep down
+
+
+
Waking was a struggle for dominance

The drunkeness that was
Life living under the dead

Time stripped of the restraints
Civilization straps on it

Time free as liquid
That the only constant

Day Hour Second
None had any use here

No sun nor moon

Life much nearer to the natural
Now & Past all that remained to matter

Soupy food at arms length
The sip of it had kick

Slipping in & out
Until after a deep rest
He became alert
Cleared of his intoxicated state

He must have passed out
Under some large plant

Nothing to be seen around him

When he realized the sword
Was no where to be felt

He knocked plants
All around in a panic

Dusty flew up
& Bloomed light to the room
+
+
+
Ghastly ghouls
Surrouned him in a cave

Forms abstract yet mechanical
Oceanic organisms perched up in odd ways

~ boy you wake
~ to serve us


The one that spoke hosted five large eyes
Perched upon fingerbones
Lashed by sinewy vineline muscles

Head a bulbous mass
Like an octopus
Beard of tentacles
Reselmed the cave

The tongue of the creature
Stuck out sloppily
As it forced spped

Fleshy  a pink in that only-human tone
Against the chromatic scales of the creature

The neck was the hipbone
Attached to the spine & ribcage

Long-since Dead
Irovy by Time

The bones held a deep white
Whereever they exposed
In engineered locations
No part natural to to other

One arm like contrapion moved on to top
Its 6 five-node fingers moved as one does speaking

A five feemer long leg 
Rooted on a polar double foot

The other leg at the other end of the ribcage
Shorter that ended in a crab-like claw formed of jawbones

The ribcage a gastly jellyfish like clear tenacle mass
That enveloped a definite human brain

~ boy you will not look at me like that
~ twain you value you last breathe

At the end of the creature
Wag'n the fresh tail of a dog

The boy bounced up from the moss 
That carpeted this cavelike domocile

He leapt to offensive  positions
At the creepers around him

His eyes could no longer behold the vile things
Permit'n only perephrial consideration
As he rent all those 
Grasped by his gorilla like terror


In a whipping flash the thing cluctched his bleeding jaw
Forcing the boy to meet the eyes of the creature
~ show me with respect & love
~ or die

' Where is my dog
' You gangly muthrfkrs
The boy shouted as he grabbed the claw appendage 
In a heave rooted by his planted legs

The boy whirled the creature around
Crashing against a barnacled wall

The tore up mass
Fell in tumbles against the rock wall

' Where is my dog
The boy shouted again
Advance'n at the creater
Now cower'n under
Disturbed dusty light
+
+
+
The other ceatures taken into a startled paralysis
Made no move to approach he who had dismantled the leader

~ WHAT MEATY BROOTH DOETH THE DOG DELIVER
The dismembered leader laughed vengful whooping way

The boy was out of the room
& Thru the corridors

Unperturbed by the message 

His inner thighs 
Where the meat met his underwear

Soon began to cry out in burning sensation
As the skin rashed where it met piss-soaked cotton

The structure was made out of stones
Crablike spiders scruttled inside their shelters in fear

Dwellings bound the stones together strongly
All that was to do was place to stones as one saw fit

Inenvitably the spiderlikes would host themelves
& Bind the structure into a solid

Discarded outside with the hilt deep in the moss
The blade reflected the blue light of the fog around it 

## DOG #################

That he would be able to begin the quest
Out of this place

The weight of the loss
Unbearable & so set aside

A bark rose
From the distance

Then in a sudden
The form of his dog
Appeared triumpant
At the crest of 
The boy's old trail

They reunion'd in a run
Each by the other swept

In embrace

# BACK ########################3

Days from the entrance
The two continued easily
Down the widely blazed trail

Upon look'n down
From a hill crest

A large beast
The size of a house

Loom'd ominously
Over a bobcat busy dodge'n

The lethal path
Of squirted water
Which seared all
In quick bursts

The cat unwaivered
Juked left then ahead
At the house monster
In murderous pounces

Instantly the behemoth
Disappeared and became
A flow as if by break of dam

The frog an illusion
Of a gigatic spew of water

The tusamni nearly
To the level of the two

The audacious bobcat
Washed far out of sight

Upon a rock
There sat a frog

A minature version
Of the beast before

The toad turned 
& Looked at their direction
'Well hello you two
'See me wash the pussy out that cat?
'She dun screeeeaamm in terror

The toad continued talk'n
As he hoped over to them
'Dem muthrfkn pussies 
'Best know not
'To mess we those of my family

'They call me
'Wart Dragon

The toad hoped up
High stiff toad legs
Dip'n torso in bow

'This is Bo
'& My name is Huck

'Well my good men
The toad arm motioned 
Their compliance in path
'We will all die
'By next breeze
'If we stay here

The toad hop'd ahead
Hurriedly entirely expect'n compliance

Huck stayed put

'Boy
The toad whip'd out
The tongue smack'n Huck cheek
'The Wash is coming
'It will burst 
'By the next breeze

The two submit'd to follow
They went lower down
The next valley towards a large cave

In the cave
Then under it

They pop'd up
Into a large dome room

Countless toads
Birds & all else in mass

All wait'n as if
For the speech of a god
+
+
+
A bellow came as if
Of god himself

All earth quaked
In tune with
The shudder'n voice

'BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
The open entrance
From which they entered
Blew up to the large cieling 
There was a flash flush
Of boiled over water
+
+
+
That spectacle que
To the mass in hurry
Down thru the open'n

Tho all different
All kept to their own business

Get'n back to life

Huck now saw all openly

The large open valleys
Coral trees like sand in count
Great boundlers of barnacles

All the world now exposed
Every plant a dry stiff taffy like twig
+
+
+
'Aye der Ma
The toad introduced
A family that surrounded him

'Gramps what happened

'Did you soak that pussy

'Did you take its tail

A swarm of children
Demanded storytell'n

The toad turned to them
'Well so as soon as all left me

That cat tried to come 
Take its last shot at me

But you know your gramps
He never lets pussy pass

I blew up last seasons soak
All at him in prelude to the BOOM
These two seen it all
In a stupid astonished look

I had to bitchslap him
In order to get him
To follow me fore the big boil

The children all croaked in hoots
The story told as they kept enroute home
+
+
+
Whatever path the boy had cut
Huck knew was washed away
