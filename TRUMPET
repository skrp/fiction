'I wish
'My president
'Was my best-friend

'Fresh Carribean Rolls
'President Trump
'& A suite

'Of any person
'Ever in existence
'I'd take Trump

'Free to get wreq'd
'As we want

Those words the gateway
To its reality

As if the universe
Played passive
To hearts desire

Putin roll'n
Coked up with thugs

He didn't greet me
It wouldn't be proper

But he gave me a
Swift look

That was as
Solid & Invite'n
As handshake

Of the 2 tables
All out
But the 3 of us

50 Million dollars
& Both my kidneys
On the table

Hooked up & handled
By a Nobel Laureete

'All In
I called

Eyes on Putin
'Maybe I make you Russian
He laughed pleasantly
'Call

Trump who was only in
Because he put me to lose
For a few
Lost of interest easily responed
'Call

King of Clubs
3 of Spades

The pair won me at
Johnnys

Now
Made me a millionare

The Laureete
Replaced my organs with such grace
I could hardly tell
They were ever out

Somke'n Cubans
Just jet'd in

The Laurette busy work'n
But us three casually talk'n

Trump & Putin
Neverend'n
About their adventures

Save'n the world
From ninjas to androids
To when they had to breach dimensions

Third-wheel those hours
My highlight

Before the end
I'd instigate
The action
Of the end of the world

Into a night
That even they
Would never forget

No pics or vids
Never forget'n
Trump crowned
With a gold MAGA cap

On the grounds
OF the National Monument

At peak flight
Of Putin's
Russia Special Dip

Myself have'n used a tie
To makshift a thong

Nudity for a reason
No one could remember

Run'n from hummers
Escaped into the
White House

For a reason
None of us remembered

Have'n to get
Soaked in the thorny bush
Cold & naked
But do'n my best not to show it
In presence of King Putin

Thru a window
President Trump left open
For this exact purpose

We hoisted ourselves
Leave'n blood streaks
That already got
Distant dogs howl'n

Pass'n out
On the Presidetial Rug

Have'n to lay on
Last weeks hooker's towel

Wake'n up mid-air
Freak'n out
Tethered to a helicopter

Get'n pulled up
By Russian Special Forces

Grab'd inside by
Princess Ivanka

On critical mission
To protect the life
Of our Princess

From the BLM squad
Sent by Barak Obamamma

Bullets flew
Spotlights ever accurate

I caught the blaze
As if on premonition

It at the corner of my eye
A laser weapon from space

As if pulled
I took Princess Invanka
In my arms

Unhindered by the
Hopeless Russians

We lept
In a hurdle'n mass
Princess in arms

The flash of a beam
Gone but linger'n as a ghost

Erupted the helicopter
In blue explosions

Duck pond
Against air pressure
But the only option

There allowed the
The Princess unharmed
From land'n thru me

Saved by her
All muddy & fierce
As she unstuck
Me deeply embedded
In the muddy muck

Bruised
But nothing broken

Princess Ivanka
Carried me to
A 10 hut village
Which became apparent
Was North Korea

In the local dialect
She asked for
Gum cigarette coca-cola
Cooper-wire & rubber gloves

She ladder'd to the powerlines
Took apart her ear'n
& Hack'd herself
Into the direct line
Of His Majesty Kim Jong

A limo
Rated nuclear-bunker

Soon picked up the Princess

Inside the mod Cardinal
An immensity of a man
Put put his hand
As I made way to enter

The man's hand
The size of my chest

I was too muddy
& The interior was sacred

'Go to Bangladesh
'To the Royal Sweet

A business card
Hidden by his massive fingers
Fluttered lightly down
As he drop'd it
For me to catch

The Princess cried
At the brisk part'n

A last micro second sight
Of beauty in memory

Precious past probabilty
Liable for fruad

After the sounds
Of the large engine
Lost in mountain passes

Dazed at the last
24hrs Exactly
When I bumped into
President Trump

North Korean Mountains
Starve'n in only a tie-thong

& A Malaysian Passport
Name'n my 17yr-old mugshot
King Reginald His Magesty XIV
