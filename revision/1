###### ESOTERIC ORDER of DAGON

~ A story of cosmic ~
~ Quantum portal hack'n ~


Clank clak clik
Todd ran his hand down lockers line'n empty halls

15 Minutes past the point of no return 
Any student this late would get writ-up
Ironically worse than not show'n up 

`Devil has idle hands when works harvest
Todd inspired himself to no avail
His purpose was below
But as things become mounted by endless anticipation
The energy now block'n him
Aun compel'd him to do opposite

The thump of Todds feet steady step after step up stairs to higher floors
_

The mellow ambiences shattered
As patters of run'n feet charged towards his direction from around the corner

Fortune had placed Todd directly opposite of the girls restroom

The distance was leapt in one bound to rush inside the last stall
He let out a cocky breath of relief

!! KAK !!

The cracked seat hing broke
His left foot plunged ankle deep in piss water
He caught his balance with his arms to save the other
Feet pivot'n on the grimy rim one looked paper mache 
_

The door quietly opened and someone made an attempt to open the first stall

A muffled yell came from still far away
'BEN WE KNOW YOUR IN THE GIRLS

!! BOOM !!
Heavy legs near cracked the door in half in an over ambitious action

As a small spark explodes the whole a volcano burst from startled pressure

!!! BRAPPPPPPPPPPUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSSPPPPUUUPPPPTTTTTUUUUPPPPP !!!

The entire school vibrated with its echo

!!! GAWDDAMN BEN YOU SHOULDA SEID WHY YOU NEEDED THE GIRLS 
One of the schoolhall monitors hooted out for the entire school

The last of this announcement was gagged out as the gas particles bloomed out as thick cloud
_

The room was silent still after the door fell shut and resettled

!! PAT !!
!! PAT PAT !!

'Gonna make your fat cunt ass eat that shit you bich
Ben kicked at the stall now braced shut by legs

'Back off
Todd step'd out of the stall

Ben turned to him even more crazed
'You!   You are the reason I got chased

Todd was tackled to the wall slam'n hard as his wet foot slip'd out

-walk'n around
-like you not ditch'n class
Ben muffled as he struggled out his revenge


Todd manuevered around use'n Bens force against him
Then with his forarms place'n Ben in a locked hold 

'The teacher notified the Monitors and got me caught
Ben self righteously continued
_

After several curses and a long pause
'Alright asshole you made your point


Todd pushed him off to a safe distance

The toilet flushed and another boy joined the scene in the girls restroom

'Sorry about that      Im sick
Jordan blushed out the awkward introduction

They all knew that morn was go'n to haunt Ben a long time
For a while they were content with breathe'n the gas locked in their with them

_

Walls washed over & over white couldn't fully conceal the deep red of the grafitti the boys assumed was paint
Piss marked all to a feminine territory

Curiosity only met horrors to the boys never have'n been inside 

'This place is kinda creepy
Ben broke the silence after all of them had been repelled from investigations
Stuck here with no where to go until the class period ended

'There is a hum that sounds like a whimper
'Can you guys hear it

'Probably this school is hella haunted
Jordan put in authoritatively

Todd drew nearer to the vent that was stained as a dump for feminitity
'It comes from the trashcan vent

Suddenly Todd spoke into the vent
'We can hear you

( need help help please help )

The whimper so faint Todd looked for confirmation at the other two
Who had instantly drawn themselves nearer to the source

( help us    please )

'Here      we are here
'Where are you
Jordan ventured down

( can you hear me  hello please help )

'We hear you
'We will get the Principal
Jordan said take'n control of the situation

[ noooooooooooo ! ]
The shriek took all three back in a tight terror
[ they did this to her! ]

'Who ever you are
Todd said firmly
'Where ever you are
'We will find you
'That is a promise

Todd left immediately with the others follow'n dazed 
Only sure that there was no concieveable direction from which to start
To keep what seemed a reckless promise
