All looked across to the other
Each sat legs crossed & settled comfortably

A large wick candle blazed crackily
Smoke thick cloudy with a heavy mint aroma

There was a omnious sound that first wasn't heard
It crept upon their awaken'n concious 

'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh
All were sync'd of mouth
There was no Miss on Jewels

Jewels eyes burst widely open
'They have arrived to our call

'Welcome all four
'9 Long months we
'Chanted out for thee

'Many have come & gone
'But you we only seek

'I am the Grand Prophet Jewels
Jewels spoke in a firm beauty that all had heard in their minds

'My kin have on santified planes
'Exchanged their voice for mine

'My voice is true & worth their sacrifice
'A monks life was not my companion's choice but given
'In a sacrifice bless infinite realms
'As echo I beseech thee to meet in thy realms

'God Dagon is now lured to your lands
'Thru your reality all our realities will be exposed
'All efforts ever made by this Earth's existence will be swallowed null
'In the infinite gluttony as all are made as feast

'You must stop it
'I have forseen you will

One woke slowly
Entranced by chant
A sound that slowly woke them

Dryness of mouth 
Welled up deep tears of agony

Each across the other
Crossed on sore legs

All drug themselves heavily
To the banks of purity

Not for hours did they speak
Jewels too put out to setup a vapor

All of them put out & passed out on an off

All looked at Jewels with wonder
Miss still asleep out to a distant cold

The instant Jewels woke Miss collapsed of exhaustion
Jewels bleed have'n elsewise died from dried caked blood 

Three days & nights they had sat 
Pulled form body to bridge the connection

A powerful Jewels had dealt them great harm 
To wretch them in so great a suffer'n unparallel

Two days they lay on that grass
Grass nurtured them under unabated sun

Miss in a broken form
Old woken to a novel hell
The greatest shock in old age

Saggy as a tumorous rasin
Each full of pity for wrongs against her

After two weeks of torment ferried life to death's gate 
Full Harvest Moon 
Tide as never seen before pulled to great waves that splashed respectively at the ceremonial pyre

Burn'd back as space
In the comsic burial of the flame

Drift wood piled high
Gulf wind as great engine

Themselves they found
Were ones greatest enemy
