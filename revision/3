Someone was trap'd & beaten in the concealed subbasement of the school
Whoever was run'n the system would no doubt do likewise to the trio of boys

In an abandonded level layers from help  with only one known exit by an elevator shaft
Mousecraft was the sure way to go about a thing
Patience & longwait'n until absolute vacancy was established

For the entire period they waited between bells that could still be faintly heard

The room they hid in was hardly worth explore'n
All was strewn around in some odd position of total abandonment
_

Their eyes & senses now accustomed they proceeded
The halls were built in the same structure as their school, one large hall circled the outside classrooms and inside classrooms

All told obvious signs that this path no longer used
Jordan headed their search track'n in the dust to know how long since use
The inside of the classroom had been the highest end of vacancy in the specturm
_

Soon Jordan was on a path that was taken daily
One heads of the path led to a stairwell
The other head they followed to a large open room

Workstations arrayed the entire space

A low hang'n light over a stone table 
Rusted rungs were imbed'd as obvious retraint ports

Below the top were various shelves for various instruments
Jordans heart aun fainted terror when it became obvious all the tools in all the stations down all the rows had been used recently

There where daily tracks, recent tracks, no tracks 
This room was recently used for massive operations

The only daily path led to a table far at the end with the light on
_

Strapped to the table by leather cuffs was a nude redheaded girl
So bruised was her face that one could only assume she was freckle faced
As the rest of Jewels body
Freckled to the point that tho blood, aged & new, was only the second characteristic noticed

She had stichess from where she was opened
Many such patches were seen in similar fashion all over her body

Her shut eyes sprang into maniac alertness expose'n large teary yellow orbs
Three boys not monsters, stood over her

'How to we get these loose
Jordan asked her after he was unable to free any strap

Confused near exhasperated
'How the fk do I get these off

Jewels looked back at him and opened a mutilated stump of a tongue 
Jordan thankful he had been heretofore numbed by shocking things

'Finally sorry 
'I cant speak even breath
'When you move like that
Infantile hands pushed its way out of the hair to emerge a shrunked older head
_

The trio looked agast at a girl who had a shrunked torso attached 

'Yes this is a shock I understand
The little head said in a small voice

Jewels cast her face to the side ashamed, not only nude but openly disfigured

The little head made a small exhasperated sound and moved into itself
A lump bulged and moved like a hamster under her skin from her shoulder to her throat

'I talked to you earlier by broadcast'n it from her vocal cords
'The bands are one leather belt    Above our head you can release it 

The lump moved back into the shrunked torso it puppeted
'Jewels hates when I do that

Jordan found the clasp to be an odd shaped clasp that took some ingenuity before it was released
Also with help of the metal bar and 6 arms

Jordans whose shirt was mostly non bloody was offered to Jewels
'We need to hurry the goons will be back soon
'If we are still subterranean when that happens we will have no chance whatsoever

The shrunked form like to talk with its hands using the motion of its arms to excentuate what its voice was limited in express'n
 
Promptly they made exodus from that devilish laboratory room
The walls of the place vibrate'n with unspoken legions of torment

The light had a cruel elderly tint of an aged desperation for more life at any cost
_

The cord was now clean to allow them all quick access back up to the basement
Not till they reached the closet door did they recognize their perdicament

Todd was smeared over in blood, Jordan was shirtless
All were caked in dust
Jewels looked too much to mention

They would be seen before they could breach the grounds
The front exit was always guarded by Monitors

Monitors trained in take'n down groups of kids
They wouldn't have a chance against that end
