000000 TODD   00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
All the world was inside dome of earth with illuminesent roots dangle'n drip'n light 
As if a massive volcano covered all but could not break some sort of barrier

The plants glow'd in shine'n marvels
Each plant different with unique florescent mathematical patterns

In primal joy of a hack-n-slash tunnel boar'n with a giant sword that swung resistless

'My dog     I need to find my dog
'I pass  my voice to you

The movement was hurried but the pace of endurance  a steadyness in the subborness of a wore & hopeless heart

Plants plenty that burst as a warm slushy tastful sticky goo
Each bite was gorgeous but none allowed him a sense of fulfillment

'Dogs   Dogs logically gravitate towards high corners in a dome like this
'Echoes will seem to originate from each and call to the dog naturally 

The epiphany was a burst of joy to the boy 
Even Todd understood the source naught his own
A silent passager had spoke thru a vocal passerger 

The elation of that understand'n knocked with a force 
Todd bolt'n up still cuffed

000000 BEN    00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Darkness 
Darkness but a candle

No he was turn'n to dark walls of different colors
His hands worked fast on one of the many keyboards that laid on the massive workbench

Lurch'n into a roll around in a chair

clickity clack clak 

Colorful code displayed on various terminals
Each be'n review'd over and over
The characters would pour down, 
Each to fill him with satisfaction never so deep

He would immediately push on to the next
Allow'n him to digest & comment

White line all prepared with an odd manner
'Give me guidance 
'I have gone as far as I can 

With a swift habitual movement his hands made sign
Cut out a symbol in the white

SNIFF

Ben's eye jerked open darkened by Todds shadow sit'n up
The fire was longsince burnt out and he was cold

The memory only a elongated blur of him work'n
Long time coffee-brew in acts of combine'n & reform'n

000000 JORDAN 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Work every second a drag
New customer same complaint

New room same mop
In & out in a dreary life

Forced by the system this way with no escape
On pentance for being too poor to afford house'n

Believe in yourself
You can survive alone

Take heart & leave this all behind
Fuck your asshole father & your bitch mother
Your older brother can go to hell for steal'n your last paycheck
Boss here is a one-of-a-kind muthrfkr

Use your next paycheck to get a pack, bed, tarp, & weapon

000000 JEWELS 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
She was radiant with sunrays that sparkled off her hair, off her eyes, that bounced from her wet tongue to framed mirror
The bike hop'd onto the rail and skid down trail'n sparks

I shouted partly aroused 
There a deep well of sexual desire to be cast with Jewels in forbidden love

I was wear'n roadbike cleats that clicked metalically with each step
_

All awoke with Todd
But all felt in control

Time they understood in that realm was null
As if without gravity warps away lines of traditional perception

'This symbol here 
Ben redrew larger the polygon 

'This means something to me now I can feel it      
'I want     I need to tatoo it on my knuckles

Jewels steadied by her lack of empathy for other's pain
Used the root of an herb with the ink of an octopus that Jordan harvested
Todd used hemp to draw the symbols

The project became an ordeal which never stop'd
Symbols & Shapes expounded from knuckles up the arm
Amplified in pattern by each dream

With a natural sunbleached spine she worked upon his hands a mixture 
Augmented by Miss who together made a masterpiece
Ben's fists made mirror images of the symbol in black which turned to a light brown-red under the sun
_

Friday night set for ordeals of longsuffer'n adventure
They would do rites of fume induced sleep upon the Dunes

To wakeful nights that set calm stages as passive scenes for their worked desires

Adventure mostly returned them to the city
For four days they would migrate thru Jordans many spots

City life was necessary to trade for goods
Jewels made aroma-therapy candles that she parted off for high prices

Water wasn't plentiful at the Dunes nor was the enviornment kind to plants
Miss had informed them of Jewels idea to grown her own plants
Massive acres of farmland would be ideal places to plant where they would be watered under ample sun

True power of plant magik only unlocked thru the engeries one spent towards it
To reap its fruits but never its body

Jewels had cared from seed a slew of  month old plants
Each had one now nested on their bikes

Jordan had constructed a one-wheel trailer for this low-rider
His load was the most but the laid back position kept the high winds off him

The agitation on the plants would present long lasting danger which would secure their position & bond
Roots would grip with a steadfastness that would empower them on plentiful plains 
_

Across town & down endless roads
Each truck pass'n honk'n at them
In say'n they were watch'd strangers

Roll'n together like a pack of holligans up to no good

Hours passed into moonlight
Jewels finally stop'd the pack

'Yes there is deep water in the air
Miss affirmed with a sense of pride
Jewels arms skyward outstrech'd soaked in the energy

Bikes were stashed inside the overgrown streetside drainage
Jordan always covered them with a dark tarp he locked
'Bikes always will betray their location with a sparkle if any part is exposed 
'Lets see someone manage to lift four awkwardly placed bikes locked in tarp
Jordan was always up to his practical ingenuities that bore him confidence

Jewels carried her pepper plant
The strand a variation of her own of the Witches root
Peppers kept off parasites, peppers helped keep meat, leaves produced thick smoke

10 Acres in they walked along the fence 
Bugs bit at their salty sweaty bodies in a frenzy

A small hill held a resivor of water
Leakage made the path difficult
Muddy, bit & cut from invasive plants

They fought thru a path decades old
Jordan pointed at the rusted hinges on the gate they easily hurdled

More signs of long abadonment appeared
A old camp chair was next to a rusted thru tin bin full of decades old crushed beer cans

Strewn about were odds that spoke of a person who used this place to be alone
It must have been misery to choose this mosquito infested parcel as lounge

'This is definitely manmade
Ben said assured by certain molds of the hill that had longsince become organic

They twisted & curved make'n a path that Jordan knew was pointless to attempt to hide 
Plants were too thick & greedy for space
_

Foliage was 10 feet high but at the summit all broke into a grassy knoll 
Open & impossibly larger that what look possible below

The water was a small pond flush with the ground
One would think it a hole too dark to be ventered carelessly

Then notice their reflection mirroed back at them in soft ripples of night darkened waters

The plaque at the Downtown memorial described how difficult of a process it took to engineer a perfect water mirror
Here under full harvest moon was a more perfect reflection

No buzz of bug nor intrusive plant on this high plane of mount
The grass untamed by man retained a lush kentucky green, cool & soft to lay upon
Blades of it didn't cut the skin, more it clung like fresh moistured gauze
The face of it a balm to tired & bit & sunbaked flesh

After two minutes with plants aside the manmade waterhole
All unknowingly let themselves be drifted off to quantum realms
