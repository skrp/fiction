At 10 min to the bell the hall is at its most empty
No one typically allowed out so near the bell

The trio made their way now sure of no obstruction
The Monitors would be back in their lounge on the couch

'I discovered this door when I got lost mid school project first year
'All year I been try'n to work myself up to it 

'I spent the past 2 years dream'n about explore'n
Now there was a curious need

The girl said she was lower on the second basement down
Todd was one of the few people who knew about this possibility & had a way in 

The door was hard to explain 
Todd felt the idea would be best explained on site

They followed the stairwells down
Crossed lengths of halls of the first year students

'When I was first year I got lost 
'I followed noises that sounded as if call'n to me 
'It didn't use my name but I knew the call was for me

'The door was unlocked & I kept walk'n until I turned to see it
'Far at the other end a black hole with a door 
Todd looked ahead determined
The pent up forces now unleashed propel'n forward

Jordan stir'd with the brisk walk expounded
'Does it go down
'I did research on this school for all my papers
'This floor is suposed to be the basement
'There was one article of a peculiar incident

'A boy was found brutally seperated in a satanic ritual
'The article said the incident was found out by the janitor
'The Recession took his home & he slept at school 

'The article mentions the location at the 3rd basement floor 
'That could be considered a typo becuase there is only one basement
'But there was'nt yet a third floor above
'University Hospital was built on top of the school much later


'I been here all 3 years of school
Ben countered at the steamroll'n logic

'If there was a sub basement there would be some proof
'A reworked stairwell, but still there would be left structural pillars
'You both believe that a stairwell could just disappear

Ben's logic was solid but life seldom follows logic
_

The exterior wall held a corner closet
Todd's sweaty palms slid on the locked knob

'Let me get this
Jordan knelt in front, took off his pack, and retrieved a pouch

The door was open and pack on Jordans back before the other two could follow 
_

A narrow closet exposed by the small window
Once inside to the back after the brooms & mops the back was revealed to turn to a corridor
The narrow corridor followed the exterior wall

'Ah I always thought it was odd there were no small windows in any of the rooms
'This is the real outer wall
Ben said as endorphins flowed into his brain as bounty of an oft asked question

The wall was made of an old brick that was large & thick
The bricks that comprised the earlier build'n were a dark purple like the color of space
_

The tunnel was bare and held no purpose, no back doors to any classrooms
It only contiuned after long passages to one end

It came up as a blank wall

'The architect must have been a comedian
Ben chirp'd

'Or a way to hide the entire school in a closet
Jordan countered
'This bay is huge & was wild
'Pirates used to come here to raid
'Times they had kidnapped children

Ben noticed on the old brick
As if a boy had carved a symbol
Bored here wait'n while all society in life to death struggle


'When I got lost I came to the end I found this
'I dont remember how
Todd added as his nails scraped against the wall until he found the edge

Jordan moved him out of the way as he went to work with a thin but strong steel bar
Which he pulled out of his pack
The peeled paint revealed a metal door 2ft above the ground 3ft high & wide

Todd took the bar from Jordan and pry'd open the hinges to a creak & submission
Somehow Todd always knew this went down & now he saw into its hard depths

Dark musty air flowed immedately to them strong as a gulf breeze
Something caught Todds eye which he poked with the bar

Elevator cords hung in the mid obscured by the darkness

'If there are 3 lower basements then there are two floors to explore

After an exchange of glances to assess compliance
Jordan looked casual & Ben looked like he would not back down

Todd reached with extended arm and grasped the cord, pulled hard, and let himself be drawn into the darkness

Unexpectedly Todds hands began to slide and he rapidly descended scream'n

!!OHSHIT
_

All was dark
Distance was an abstract measurment

He ventured his legs out and managed to stop himself at near splits

!!! TODD
The other two screamed frantically down

'Im okay    Im okay
Todd said look'n up the only ray of light that emited from the door


'There is oil on the cords, I should have expected that I wasn't think'n 
'Gonna take off my shirt and use it to hold wrap around my hands for grip

'Do you need help up
Ben asked automatically without idea on how to back up the offer

'Its best only one person be on the cord at the same time
'Im gonna try to find the doors that lead the the lower floors
Todd fearless began to lower himself now at a controlled rate
_

Todd in the commotion didnt inspect for any doors in between
The best course would be to climb up slowly to ensure he could get back up, which he was still unsure was possible
He would feel for an open'n with this feet

The slide down had cleared off most of the oil
His hands how had clean purchase
The only sound was his breath and the swell of air

Todd felt a gust on his stomach
It didn't come from below

He stomp several places

!TWANG
A sliver of light beam bore into the darkness

'I think    I think I found it

With one hand he felt for a handle, the door was there, he could feel the cold metal
The door had no interior handle

!! POMP !!
!! POMP POMP !!

Todd stomped on it until a corner bent down 
He pulled himself higher and kicked down on the corner door force'n it lowered

'Im off the cords Come down
'Wrap your shirt around your hands
'I will be here to grab you if you need it

Ben & Jordan followed and swiftly entered
Todd couldn't be seen in the darkness

Ben climbed inside scrape'n his knee
Look'n up saw Todd and shrieked

!FUCK

Ben fell back on his ass in the dust

Todd was near completely covered in dusk caked dark blood mud
It had been blood not oil that had been on the cords

Smears were left all over where Todd had touched himself
_

This level was an abandoned hospital
All lay as if people had been immediately sealed off

Dusked caked everywhere & Jordan could easily see their tracks back
They went forward in a cautious adventurous manner

At the end of the first hall Jordan looked into a room
On the bed was a familiar form

'Hold up

Jordan walked inside the room that only had a bed pan & a bed
With a swift fling he threw off the blanked

A long decayed corpse lay there
The smell stung their noses sharply

The horror was simple
No screams or fear of life
Only a complete surety that their life was in danger
_

A loud clang shuffle and wacks where heard with yell'n
A hoarse voice immedately was silenced 

The boys had taken shelter in an abandoned room
Wait'n for the commotion to settle down in order to proceed with the promise
