The sun only an hour before noon
Find'n it a surprise to find that there was movement in his house
To defy the prophecy of Miss entirely

Not till after Todd entered the gate did he hear disturb'n sounds
The franctic followups between smashed revealed more than mere accident

The relief a trojan horse to betray to abismal terror

Todd bore in head first into an immediate scene of mental chaos

Cats were everywhere in feline frenzy
A large one immediately charged for an attacked
Todd had two smart on it with a kick
Of the 10 cats that moved towards them in the attack
None of them cared much to risk in same fate of their leader

It a goolike mash upon the walls
Which in any other circumstance'd make them salivate

Several cats were on his mother swarm'd on the couch
With a justice that can only be filled with rigtheousness Todd clear out the house

His parents now foam'n at the mouth claw'n at the puss foam'n at each scratch
They were past dead & tears when the last of the cats in the house caught in his grasps

Bathed in warm guts as he would use his might to break them legs to legs above his head till belly burst
This act would have all other cats in a lunacy to avoid the same fate

Cats always take too long to do anything aun to their demise
10s of bodies already litered the home as if a massive dog was unleashed with reason not mercy

Yet the tail end of near 100 cats led in mass in the same direction
_

Over short distance the cat is fast but over the distance mankind reigns supreme
Aun to naps the cats will be put off guard by the scent of the approach'n pack

The four over fence, thru yards, along country road, over cemeteries
Until finally rocky bays of ocean water rock to rock at an elevated mass of rock
The Cats with agility climbed up but still Todd much faster

The cats from boulder to boulder jummped defy'n the utter death of a mistake
Only one entry to a thicket walled bay Todd climbed up bleed'n from barnacled summits

A twist'n narrow tunnel opened up into a vast expanse 
Antiquated farm equipment animals of a startle'n variety all went around fire stained pits
One solitary hut built large as a warehouse loomed in the center

Tatched to sustain hurricane winds the edifice a concrete foundation
Bedrock to a large layer of sand  

A large bonfire pit in the center of the circular lot the center open two times larger
The whole was engeineer with a genius
If strong winds blew too hard it was structured to reel up its barrier to be easily extended later

As the cat with the first warn'n returned with message
It was tailed by Todd himself as if that message only to introduce the Reaper 
For that old woman to suffer a much more terrible fate
Slow is man to be slain barehanded

The three finally caught up to dunes
The cats would not near the area
All sat outside in a countless ring

Too tired from their massive trip
Too frightened to go home

Off to himself and they themselves overly content with rest'n 

Jewels stomached her way around the witch's hut
Parts of the witch were so scattered such that she hoped the reason to be that the cats took at picking

Leatherbound Tomes laid up balcony structures that held a pit in center an iron pike to hook a cauldron
Jewels spent her time in the study of these and the deduction of the items still remain'n in each pit
_

A city look'n for them

There was no where to go but where they were
The supply of the witch would last them years

A water from a resivoir the size of a pond kept clean a source
Firewood came pentiful off the ocean drifts

Three weeks went by with even less words between them
All had lost much & only Jewels came out on top

As if ordained with the methodology of ones soul
Jewels absorbed herself into learn'n the ways of the witch
_

Jordan spent his time explore'n & admire'n the excellent situation of the island
This base would prove his most beloved 
Built from foundation to be off the grid but preserve'n arguably better utilities

A sandy cliff of ones own to drop off to ocean waters that moved in predicatble ways
One leap would exfoliate ones skin in a deep cleanse

Sea life was plentiful
_

Ben & Todd in similar circumstance
Understood each other as entirely divergent as their reactions conflicted

There was a global power that aimed to get them at whatever cost
To send cat assassins crafted by wiccan conjury of which Jewels with the aid of Miss abstracted

Jewels created her tome larger than four textboots in rectangle
In one large wooden shield The iron that bound sturdy wear resistant leather pages

The leather made from the thin flesh of dead cats
Of which due to Todd was in lifetime abundance
That cats revere'n Todd like an awesome diety
Tho all the others they favored gratuitously in a way of one redeemed to a good master
_

Day after day the testimony that all is only just another day
This the song of every bay its exiestence at times only seasons

Todd & Ben both well healed in time
With that careful slow heal'n of a healthy way 
In that way form a resilient seal to use it as battery from which to draw energy on daily basis

Ben have'n only the unix kernel & internel manpages from a solar powered onsite station
Todd in his day long meditations on core new meanings now exposed
Jordan lived in utter peace as if time finally paid back from ever turbid ages

Jewels armed as was Arthur of The Knights of the Round Table
Her shield a tome like a sceptere the mass of it a shrine to her newfound way
Miss ever diligent to guide and grow her talents into abilities
