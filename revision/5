Todd led the exhausted group up the hills towards his home 
Ben had not said a word but his contenance exposed the truth

If this was about Ben it would be known 
Or if this is about yesterday 
His own life would likewise be shattered

A synchronized group says less and does more

Complain'n about the strain only weighs others down
& In the midst of a journey the strain is the general feel'n

Silent deal'n the substance of their interactions

The deep sleep of last night swept away traceless 
Only the entreched feel'n of a labor with no timely solution
Only the acceptance of pain as a state of being

The five miles drew two hours time
Under sun under cloudless sky

Seagulls squaked at them 
Enjoy'n the uncomfortable position
Of beings the gulls envied

Tables had turned to the birds favor
What is toilsome for us is a lesiure them

The world continued careless in their cars disconnected from their temporary coordinates
Distracted by the thought of the distination or deportaion

Four souls suffer'n & unable to begin to voice the matters at hand
Their own souls a full capacity try'n to come to grips with the present

The girl a freak whose utter truths laid bare under long presence
Before a set of strangers who on happenstance saved her & Miss

'My name is Miss
Jules broke the silence allow'n Miss to speak
_

The communication took time to digest
After the miles & silence of misery

Miss paitently continued
'I have been attached by operation  
'To this girl Jewels who was offered
'As sacrifice by her guardians to Dagon

The fantasic words to the drum & hum of day-to-day bustle that is life
Their worlds set in revolutions 60M times a second

Yet all seem so normal
As if the world around testifies
Whatever is go'n on 
Is just day-to-day bullshit
--Let us keep it move'n

'Dagon is a cosmic god
'Earth is bribed to him
'As an occult offer'n
'In exchange for the bounty
'To which the god bestows
'After the feast of a meal

'All this he will swallow
'To drain dry as Mars

'Great powers lie as the foundations of this cult
'The blessings of omnipotent powers uncalculable 

'Some envision an infinite life
'Indesuptably to be as god themself

'I am one of those in faith of Dagon
'All worth in exchange for a god's blessing

'Jewels was the daughter of a wealthy family
'To pay the price of a family to enter
'The prime of their seed must be exchanged

'I am 400 years old
'The symbyotic body of this girl now sustains me

'As payment into the order the past must live as the youth
'But don't you get this confused I offer much

'I heal her and repair her myself surgeon centries in experience
'I guarntee her life till old age as a promise

The arms of this creature now see as stilts puppeted
The core of it a brain shrunk to that of a squirell

The mass moved in a manmade skull the size of a golfball free to move in diffferent parts of Jewels body as stations
The right shoulder is Miss perch for when she talks caz she talks with the arms puppeted by latent muscles

'We worship the bowels of Dagon
'In her is inserted divine microbials
'This the digestion of the gods

'These sentient beings enhanced pure to worship the well being of the host as life itself
'From that sense I myself was of the first generation to live longer on hosts
'All work for the betterment of the whole which is Jewels
'I would proclaim she owes us much but she is a foolish girl with tears

'These mircobials harvested from excrement of Dagon
'Cultivated forward in the Cult

'Yes she is foolish
'Myself always busy patch'n up what she self inflicts

'Tho I am not sympathtic to her need to be kept from our modular fashion
'The inner courts ordered her to be pieced into a more streamlined being

'The operation was for Saturday 
'All the surgeons were away for a worldwide conference

All the boys the had a naw'n thought
'I am sympathetic to her, Jewels, who is held by us as a priestess
'Name annointed Jewels by the Seer who fated her to rise above the most high

'The freckles that she holds on her body are themself constellations
'To the coordinates for the universe that has worked out the best in every situation

'The Seer will seek her out because she is the map that leads us to that universe after the boon of Dagon
'The freckles change as echoes to the quantum world
'Understand this - her future has such consequence fate has map'd upon her the everchange'n direction of where to go

'Only by Dagon is this possible and with the bounty inevitable 

'Miss has been entrusted with this duty myself her humble overseer tho slave you may think she be
_

Miss stayed herself a while for Jewels to regain strength
It was not easy for Miss to talk while walk'n

'The Esoteric Order of Dagon dates to our earliest history and is defacto the oldest creed of all
'Trends have taken its symbolism to idolitary all without substance

'The image of the lord Dagon is alone necessary to weild unobstructed power as the molecules themself bow to His domain

'I myself am a prophetess ordained by the Seer of whom is secretly entitled to follow as I may
'The thunder of your friend woke us to crys loud enough to reach the depths
'Providence appeared you before us to show us the path out of the system 

'Knights & heroes pale to the deeds which you have yesterday all fulfilled

Miss was odd company to have on that long stretch to Todd's house
