The next months were spent at the Library
Each time out only to hoard & return

Winter was a bitter time of sunless days
All under a moist frozen canpoy that passed winds 

Jewels gave her all into sign language
Which effort always forgien to her
Always awkward with her hands

Boys out of patience to the strech of the task

Aun Jewels created a light system as code
When communicate'n on their long trips to the pond

She would often give the wrong words
Which the boys always took as final word before an pursuit

Once they thought she was pregnant
A topic only by jealousy partook
Till each admitted no to the other

Them have'n great fights on all levels
To return and discover Jewels actually meant 'peaches
_

The plants were grow'n strong under the care of Jewels
Now there massed a great greenery

The pond soil rich & warm to company

All knew there was something coming
They would get a message of a journey soon

Now they would prepare 
_

They woke again one morn
At the pond chant'n
The same tune of that one time
But the words only now audible

'Dagon the dragon
'Is coming thru you

It was a message their corporal bodies
Said & heard thousands of times

Their physical & mental being testified its truth
_

'This reality on the Quantum scale
'With the Order's strength longsince global
Ben charged at the others in an understandings tone
He broght them before bonefire & fast from want of food

'Our reality will be destroyed
'Who but us will be capable to forsee it

'What could we do    Its impractical to believe three boys, a girl & bikes count for jack shit
Jordan now encircle'n the crowd lead'n them to his understand'n

'True but what Ben says may be true
'Aun to hope
Todd now stood stright unmoved

'She had been chant'n nine months for our presence
'Why go thru all that to give out hopeless warning

'She has a knowledge past our understand'n 
'Moreso we all knew that she believed in us

Jordan looked up with a face that was normaly used before a long rant of self-reinforcement
'The base is always the nest of the hive
'One doesn't keep the queen away from nest

'We know the old school & we can break in I bet
Jordan looked back at their astonishment
'If we are going to do the impossible it will atleast
'Be something that I been plan'n to do since we left
All somehow creepily knew that Jordan 
Left a stuffed animal he loved to fk in the locker

Jordan only had little sense of the shame when it was brought up
Which he didn't like to bring up often though he always tried to rant-redirect to it
_

The animal was a Giant Panda named Cammie
When asked what something that private was doing in a locker Jordan only said
'I wanted to take it into the Art Room

The lack of over-explanation connected them to conclude
That room held a romantic part of his heart

They didnt know how they would live
The replica tattooed on the belly of Jordan's tummy was annoy'n enough
What a terror it would be like to live with the real thing 
_

Ben kept his network offline
His nodes only connected to local networks to siphon off data
 
From early on he discovered all traffic 
Goes redirected thru the Univeristy Hospital Hub

They have backdoor control over all the machines in this region
Most of their task is junk monitor output that no one can parse

Ben's dad knew a guy who gifted Ben his main puter
All the parts are handcrafted works by a native tribe

The purpose is to be a listener 
Only ever sniffer of traffic
Never prints left or trace

Only ever a bridge to scan data & replicate it to archive
 
'Todd you never asked me why I was chased that day
Ben said to the group all chewed roasted pepperoni front a bonfire

'I had gotten access to all terminals
'My dad flip-ta-bich & slap'd be good for that plant

'He actually came out to get me call'n me on my lie
'I didn't leave the computer lab where I planted till after 8pm
'Id catch the last bus home & say I had to piss
'Cept for my dad had come out all concerned
'Expect'n me to have him all up as Knight in shine'n shit
'So after the third hour he was pretty welled up

'But yeah anyway I ran terminals from 3am-5am to calculate the key that the region uses
'I got impatient and was check'n on the output I had print out in the janitors closest
'Those goons caught me right before that corner
'If that code is cracked, which I believe I did
'Go'n to that school is our most important task
'With that key all traffic would be plain-text to me

'Jordan maybe we sell ourselves too short
'Who else in the fk'n city could get access like that

Jordan gave him a coy cock back
'Well if its so simple why hasn't anyone else done it 

Ben only said
'I never said it was simple         Man what a hacker I was
'Moon till fkn noon
