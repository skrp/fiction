Dusty shirtless pantless bloody
They broke into the hall as cast from a horror scene
Sharply outlined to a monotony of regular moods that made the view more contrast to one who spot'd

Todd had a plan in his mind by a preplan'd route of exit
They made it to the end of the hall in the basement when a teacher stop'd her lecture see'n the four from the window
She opened the door and yelled
!!! MONITOR   MONITOR SECTION 7

The call for all students to plaster at the windows
The four spectacted as they turned the corner to rush up the stair well

From their exit down the hall was the front exit
Two large Monitors stood as sentinels lock'n down protocol

!!! MONITORS SECTION 1
They in unison boomed vigilent to keep the exit they didn't chase
Todd was already lead'n them to the other stairwells across the level 

There was no time to explain only for Todd to choose and the rest to follow
Higher up the school levels
_

Every window was filled & door blocked by curious children stir'd by the shouts
The teachers were bar'd in that way to even look to the halls

This the factor that allowed them to get to the second floor unhindered
They passed the restroom of the morn to the end of the hall

'Just do what I do and go where I go
He took out a key from his pocket & unlocked the window

They climbed onto a narrow ledge outside
The sun shone hotly on them already burn'n with exhaustion

The world around them too busy with their day to notice four odd bodies on second story Downtown
Their exit was seen by classmates but it would be time before this was transmitted to the Monitors
_

The ledge continued to an adjacent roof which they crossed to a high brached tree
The large branch overhung onto the build'n at an entangled attachment

By that means they climbed to the lower level at the back of the school
They followed alleys that led to the less traveled roads out 

Each of the boys knew how to pass this area without being seen

Jewels only had a large shirt & Ben's sweaty socks
The large city bustlers went their way without heed as the four moved in a pack follow'n Jordan
_

They arrived at the edge of the district that broke into an industrial sector for the port
Jordan turned them into an alley & thru a open'n in the chain-linked-fence that Jordan loosed then replaced after they entered

Thru a locked window they quickly entered
The edifice was as dusty as the basement
They cautiously followed Jordans movements hop'n from board to board their trace without tracks up the stairs to a room
Jordan locked the room with a chain & pushed away a cabinet to reveal a door also locked

There was an outside window that only exposed openly to the endless ocean
Dust free & ocean breeze Jordan led them thru the window to a ledge that was covered in tarps
The floor was of net'd metal of the repurposed fire exit

'I got a tank that collect rain water
'Open it & close it with this knob
He motioned them to turn around

He took a brisk wash in water heated by the sun
The water splashed far below far from any ears 

Ben said at Jordan as he dried
'So what is this you clubhouse for these exact situations?

Jordan looked down as his face blushed
'This is one of the places I go to live

They showered with Todd last as he was so bloody
_

Refreshed & completely exhausted lay'n on layers of worked-cardboard 
Ocean gusts massaged their tense skin & they slept till the next day

Jordan fed them dried fruit & granola that finished with a Mtn-Dew
'I got locations like this all over the city
'Each of them has a stash of all I need
'But I was stuck across town this week and ate bad food I stashed from a while back

'Your parents should be freak'n out

!fk
Ben then realized his perdicament with this father
His father would be wait'n with a self-righteous beat'n 
_

'Take everything I never go to the same place in the same week
Jordan trailed them cover'n their tracks as they returned to the streets

Ben needed to get to the payphone back at the lower district
The day was warm'n to a hot day which would help their overworked bodies after a stiff sleep

'I am the last of the litter with the room at the very end
'My parents wouldn't know if I was gone for a week
Todd conversated

Jordan had a rummage of clothes at that place
He raided the downtown charity rightly in need 
Jewels was decked out head to toe with garments that mostly fit

The shrunken head kept silent know'n how much its presence pained Jewels
The press'n pace of life had left Jewels still to be sorted out

After 4 rings Ben tried the asshole oldman next-door
'Heeh Hello
The old voice responded

'Mr. Grinvix this is Ben 
Ben said into the phone wait'n for sometime

'I just wanted to call to ask about my dad
'He isn't answer'n the phone
'If you see him can you tell him I'm on my way home

Ben waited awkwardly as there was only the sound of heavy breath'n

'Your dad      is dead boy
'You best get to the authorities an have em tell ya
The voice was sympathetic but immediately hung up after the message was given

Ben stood silent phone to his ear
Flabbergasted from a truth revealed lie
He always knew his dad would be there
& Now he is not there
His whole being worked to come to grips as understand'n toppled down
_

!!! PLUUPP PLUPP !!!
A police car had silently snuck up behind the crew
Its lights now bright at their backs

'Alright you ju 
The cop cut short as the pack immediately bolted

He turned & fumbled into the door he had preemptively shut
Today was not the mood to be disrespected by children

'Ben here   I got a 281 on that 48f
'Update the 48f is now a 49f 

He reversed sirens blare'n confident he didn't need to look back focused on the kids
In that action he was then fused with a pole as a overworked trucker plowed him to his death
_

Todd looked back in relief at the horrible accident
That cop was unquestionably the result of Ben contact'n his neighbor

What was this all about?
Did it have to do with Ben or what this a result of yesterday?
