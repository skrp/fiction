Driscol had been closed permenantly
All students had transferred to different schools

They learned these facts back in town at a store
A month from live'n at the bayside hovel

The lengthy trip took a whole half of day
Feline robbers allowed them a stash of funds

Jewels & the cats kept to each other fondly
Cats kept avoid'n Todd by eyesight

Downtown was half a day
The store was just more than a round trip in a day

Jordan had a surprise for us
His fabled headquarters
//DETAIl EARLIER

The store was a feast 
They stuffed the supplies into & tied-ont their packs
twinkies bread peanut-butter cheeses

They took the Downtown bus which was free for their age
_

All baytowns pull in lost loiters world wide
Each soul on drift with the tide drawn from far away spheres

The library sat on the hill with all the homeless hobos just below
The edifice kept an overgrown field to the back 
It left alone as a wild thicket

They had to crawl with their packs in front thru a maze 
Of what looked to be a rabbit trail

Relentlessness tried if found true broke into a open overgrown path
The thick vegitation as thickly netted canopy roof

Each of them bleed'n
'I put those in myself
Jordan said to their bewilderment

?What?
'Trust me I was much bloodier each day than you are now
'You will thank me for the added protection later

Dim sidewalk lights lit the completely enclosed tunnels 
Cords had been run 
Heavy & resilient cords for the Carnival
The hurricane rearraged this area, but the cords held true
Now they acted as foundation for this canopy
It was took thick for a human to pass thru 
Jordan proved true as they agreed it aun a fortress

The path led to a shed with power & water & network
Once a utilities shed that was forgotten the years that followed Huricane Karma

For 2 years the only build'n open Downtown was University Hospital which added even more power to that entity

'My grandpa used to work here 
'I discovered after a school research project on our ancestors
'I looked at the old schematics & several pictures as evidence

'One day stuck on this side of town
'It was rain'n like a muthfkr 
'& Cold as hell
'The security guard saw me wander'n & called me inside

'He told me I could stay until his shift ended
'I ate half of his lunch & dried up
'Warm'd by my first coffee 

'I was so cold I drank the entire pot
'Hell I would have used it to bathe with in the sink
'But that would have freaked him out

'I left in a very good mood & used pure force to make my way here
'There are metal cords strung from a parade that all the vegitation achors on

'I was expect'n to find the shed as four posts I could used to makeshift build something
'But as you can see it is largly left in-tack
'No doubt the Carnival sheilded it
_

The four rested on bedding stuffed with old twigs and leaves
On solid groud, a luxury lost since that day when parents were lost

Electricity filled their time 
The resource lost since that day before

Ben took a trip with Jules to return with the computer
This place a much more stable enviornment for electronics

Carefree lives beg'd obsession
Ben used his unix network'n skills to secure them deals with locals
rides, chores, grocery
They got money do'n homework for people under their grade

 
When they needed odd necessities Ben would find various people to do them
Ben had collected many names with reputation of which he manuevered to get what he needed

This deal consisted of transistors, pop-tars, Mtn-Dew, & tampons 
The guy offered to throw in an 1/8 of shrooms & marijuana
Ben who mistook them as being cook'n mushrooms, this thinking obvious from coming from the store
The well-tip'd driver put in gratefuly the paper bag 

//He had to wait for an hour in the bush
//That was Jordans oathsworn protocols
//Which Ben resistless obeyed so great was his appreciation
//He was able to tap into the regional network with always-on power

Ben had been grab'n data from the archives at the library and store'n them onto detachable drives
His mainframe constantly whirred with its different activities
It greet him as he opened the shed door with the arms of supplies

'Who ordered the weed
Jordan immediately popped up surprised 

'Jewels will like these
Miss said overlook'n Jewels rummage'n thru the bag

The boys kept down their communication naturally towards the two
Miss left no way to communicate with Jewels independently

When Todd lurched out his hand force'n the ball that was Miss in one location
The other two without preemption held down Jewels firmly

Jordan went to grab the chain, they had to settle this
Todd struggled not to strangle Miss while fight'n down Jewels
Who the two could not break to submission
Any minor victory was responded with greater loss
'We    we need to 

! CRUNCH !
Jewels head butt Tood's jaw closed

'ST STOP
Ben got at her but she let her elbows fly accoustomed to more monsterous holds

Jules broke free and ran into the restroom
Ben was pray'n his nose wasn't broken like that one kid from math

He bled out like a fountain
_

It was time before Todd got the idea to pass thru a notebook

'Trust me when I say Miss is dear to me
'Her over anyone else is my true friend

Blood is thick with one's identity
The composition is stired by one's emotion

Blood magic draws stregth from those forces
They drank the brew of shroom blood masked with mint leaves

In trance state Jewels formed an intricate DIAGRAM 
This bordered formed their ground as a circle drawn in sifted prepared sand

'May the blood split
'For concern of other
'Bind us five together

Four at each corner
Arms the connection between

The vapor off the brew to inhale them aroma of the hot brew digested
The pot laid in the circle chalked with their diagram as borders
 
Their movements like all surf'n on the same wave
All in tune at different positions to the swell

All looked at the other in odd understand'n
As if whispers built bonds stronger with assurance

They kept their hands together bound
As Jewels would voicelessly guide them over the struggles discomfort

'Comfort is a worthy sacifice
'How do you care for that which is not worth the sacrifice

'We care for each other
'If this pain bring us together
'Then what greatness we reap of the true bounty

After the hours of fast'n that followed
Naturally due to the shrooms but eleveated states nonetheless
They took their always_packed-packs & left Downtown
Instead of the left turn towards the Dunes
Jewels lead them to her old school in Uptown

The Duties were two old dike identical twins
Boot-stomp'n bruisers bristly as heft english boars

So loud was their march that it was near impossible to take the two seriously
They were went to the school to babysit

As decades passed they were finally put to the true test
An abductor of no small size atempted an idea that would end his life 

The jarhead beaten to death in a half hour struggled 
Scars on their face still bore testament to the battle

Faces of Death covers the last leathal 10min of the brawl
The kidnap'd girl ran cry'n up to the two women in gratitude

Cough'n up blood but the dangl'n man cough'n up much more
The police didn't attempt to intervene until them

In that fame they reigned never checked but never step'n out of line
But old age has its time & biological beings slept to an order 

3:30 - 3:45 Neither could keep their eyes open
The lure of that sweet rest & blissful wakefulness

'If you see two woman come'n at you
'Jewels begs you to drop everything & run
 
15min to get the bikes out
They dove in the lot sneak'n under the booth where on-que slept the two

Every action was worrisome for them 
Jewels stitched face & unseeming passager
City authorities already on the alert to get them

Have'n singlehandedly cause their school to be shut down forever 
They could only hope Jewels was smart about this move

Stressed persperation bloomed from their palms all familiar with the Duties
To their surprise Jewels confindence pulled thru without complaint

The lot of bikes were open for the take'n
Unchained by the confidence of the Duties who knew the owner of each

big small large brite pimp
A selection unparalleled by any shop

Several bikes on the front gold-colored rack grouped together
All other bikes allowed respectful space

Jules went immediately and lifted the bike on her off shoulder holding the pedal with her hand
Her bike was the leaders obvious as it was tricked-to-shit bmx bike

Todd took the practical road-bike that looked sturdy after a decade of use
Ben hoisted up a rugged mountain-bike with puffy tires
Jordan was sweat'n under his load which they gave him a 
'choose another one are you fkn serious

Here wasn't the place to debate so they swiftly headed out
Follow'n Jewels silent directions they kept the bikes from make'n noise

Unobstructed back out on the streets within 5 minutes

After make'n the turn on the corner they shouted & hooted
High speed down hill on bikes fit for them exactly

Jordan on a lowride'n bike set in all chrome 
His kicked-back position drew his left lip in a look of coolness

By the time they came off their high they were bayside front bonfire nightsky at the Dunes
They could only piece back the earlier events

Todd kept all their dealings in a record which he kept without break 
_

They all stared at Todd's replication of the DIAGRAM Jewels drew when they drank her brew
Drawn on a virgin part of the dunes at South Moon

Jewels never kept from work and produced the brew she made memorized by Miss

All attention on the moment
Each have'n lost & gained something worth longlasting contemplation 
In such states alone is the soul susceptible to higher states of being
Reenforced by the rubble of demolished states of being

The diagram was singular in fashion & make
Magnetic bonds pulled them tangibly

'I believe us all contacted by other being who reached out to us
'I understand us to be connected by quantum bonds to kindred spirits
'The bond is a constant proof of infinity as distance is of null impact

'Dagon, we are taught is the god of universe
'His echo from AEons       His might truth

'Many seek to call him forth as a gateway to divine gifts
'Tho all their world strip'd upon his arrival

'The distance that seperates the cosmos unfathomable
'Quantum properties testify that all realities come to pass that are passable

'When one acts to create possibility
'One creates universes & reworks destiny

'The distance tween cosmos unbreachable 
'Aun for the Holy Dagon

'Each life has the power infinitely strong to breah the barrier of distance
'To contact the other thru the human spirit consortium
'All hearts to power the other in a robust network

'This power when grouped by massive movements
'Can open the portal to allow Dagon God thru

'Thru ancient traditions passed down by the ages
'We reknewn tonight the Artes of Occult Cosmos Projection

'A rite learned & perfected to directly communicate 
'That experience be shared across all realities

'This diagram given to us is the public key
'Our private understand'n & connection with the symbols date a truth from severance
'Possibility Severance happens when two liknesses diverge to irrevocable paths

'We alone are familiar with symbols at each point in life
'If we are lured by dangerous hands the symbol will confirm
'Thus each in an Order of Ourself 
'To focus them inward as a check of four proofs

'Our rite will be our position we assumed earlier
'We will bind our hands & sleep 
'By purchase of comfort we will attain a way to project to other realities
'Able to learn on a scale of infinity which will all confirm singularity in a situation

Position laid natural as if only need a nudge to fall full swing
All woke each in a different quantum reality in control of consiousness at Lucid Dreams
