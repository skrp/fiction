Clank clak clik
Todd ran his hand down lockers that lined empty halls

15 Minutes past Bell
The point of no return to class
Any student this late would get writ-up
Ironically worse than not show'n up at all 

`Devil has idle hands when works harvest
Todd inspired himself to no avail
His purpose was below

But latency becomes mounted by endless anticipation
The energy now as a hurdle
Aun compel'd him to do opposite

The thump of Todds feet steady 
Step after step up stairs to higher floors
_

The mellow ambiences shattered
As patters of run'n feet charged towards his direction from around the corner

Fortune had placed Todd directly opposite of the girls restroom

The distance was leapt in one bound to rush inside the last stall
He let out a cocky breath of relief

!! KAK !!

The cracked seat hing broke 
Left foot plunged ankle deep into hour old piss & shit

He caught his balance with his arms to save the other
Feet pivot'n on the grimy rim which looked to be paper mache 
_

The door quietly opened
Someone made an attempt to open the first stall

A muffled yell came from still far away
'BEN WE KNOW YOUR IN THE GIRLS

!! BOOM !!
Heavy legs near-cracked-the-door-in-half 

As a small spark to explode the sound of volcano eruptions

!!! BRAPPPPPPPPPPUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSSPPPPUUUPPPPTTTTTUUUUPPPPP !!!

The entire school vibrated with its echo

!!! GAWDDAMN BEN YOU SHOULDA SEID WHY YOU NEEDED THE GIRLS 
One of the schoolhall monitors hooted out for the entire school
The last of this announcement was gagged quiet as the gas particles bloomed out as thick cloud
_

The room was silent still after the door fell shut and resettled
The structure itself seemed to rumble in a giggle that would last his lifetime

!! PAT !!
!! PAT PAT !!

'Gonna make your fat-cunt-ass eat that shit you scabby bich
Ben kicked at the stall now braced shut by legs

'Back off
Todd step'd out of the stall

Ben turned to him even more crazed
'You!   
'You are the reason I got chased

Todd was tackled to the wall 
Slam'n hard as his wet foot slip'd out

'walk'n around
'like you not ditch'n class
Ben muffled as he struggled out his revenge

Todd manuevered around use'n Bens force against him
Then with his forarms place'n Ben in a locked hold 

'The teacher notified the Monitors and got me caught
Ben self righteously continued
_

After several curses and a long pause
'Alright asshole you made your point

Todd pushed him off to a safe distance
The toilet flushed
Another boy joined the scene in the girls restroom

'Sorry about that
'Im sick
Jordan blushed out the awkward introduction

They all knew that morn was go'n to haunt Ben a long time
For a while they were content with breathe'n the gas 

So thick that it took them into a heightened-state
_

Walls washed over & over white 
Layers couldn't conceal the deep red of grafitti the boys assumed was paint
Piss marked all to a feminine territory

Curiosity only met horrors 
The boys never been inside the Girls

'This place is kinda creepy
Ben broke the silence after all of them had been repelled from investigations
Stuck here with no where to go until the class period ended

Todd was startled then reaffired
'There is a hum that sounds like a whimper
'Can you guys hear it

'Probably this school is hella haunted
Jordan put in authoritatively

Todd motioned them to hear near the second vent next to the garbage can
The rust smeared as Todd opened the lid for better acoustics

'It comes from the outdoor trashcan vent

Suddenly Todd spoke into the vent
'We can hear you

( need help help please help )
The sound in that way one is sure it is at great distance
In the scream full lungs & all that would rip apart your throat-lining

The whimper so faint Todd looked for confirmation at the other two
Who had instantly drawn themselves nearer to the source

( help us    please )

'Here      
'we are here
'Where are you
Jordan ventured down

( can you hear me  hello please help )

'We hear you
'We will get the Principal
Jordan said take'n control of the situation

[ noooooooooooo ! ]
The shriek took all three back in a tight terror
[ they did this to her! ]

Todd opened the lid with both his hands to shout down
'Who ever you are
'Where ever you are
'We will find you
'That is a promise

Todd left immediately with the others follow'n dazed 
Only sure that there was no concieveable direction from which to start
To keep what seemed a reckless promise

At 10 min to the bell the hall is at its most empty
Policy prohibited anyone out so near the bell

The trio made their way against no obstruction
The Monitors would be back in their lounge on the couch

'I discovered this door when I got lost mid-school at my first-year firedrill
'All year I been try'n to work myself up to go down it 

Todd was one of the few people who knew about this possibility & had a way in 

'I spent the past 2 years dream'n about explore'n
'Today is too much of a coincidence
'That door will lead us to her

The door was hard to explain 
Todd felt the idea would be best explained on site

They followed the stairwells down
Crossed lengths of halls of the first year students

'When I got lost it felt as someone called me by name 
'I followed noises tho less than a handful knew my name

'The I found a door at the end of the hall
'It was unlocked & I kept walk'n until the hallway ended at the door
'Far at the other end I saw a black hole with a door 
'I am sure it went down but I forced myself to go back

Todd looked ahead determined
The pent-up-forces now-unleashed propel'd him forward

Jordan stir'd with the brisk walk expounded
'I did research on this school for all my papers
'This floor is suposed to be the basement
'There was one article of a peculiar incident

'A boy was found brutally seperated in a satanic ritual
'The article said the incident was found out by the janitor
'The Recession took his home & he slept at school 

'The article mentions the location in the 3rd basement floor 
'That could be considered a typo becuase there is only one basement
'But at the time there was only two levels
'University Hospital was built on top of the school a decade later


'I been here all 3 years of school
Ben countered at the steamroll'n logic
'If there was a sub basement there would be some proof
'A reworked stairwell, but still there would be left structural pillars
'You both believe that a stairwell could just disappear

Ben's logic was solid but life seldom follows logic
_

The exterior wall held a corner closet
Todd's sweaty palms slid on the locked knob

'Let me get this
Jordan knelt in front, took off his pack, and retrieved a pouch

The door was open and pack on Jordans back before the other two could follow the action 
_

A narrow closet exposed by the small window bore unnatural night at the from the back
Once inside the back after the brooms & mops
A corridor was revealed to turn down a very long hall
The narrow corridor followed the exterior wall

'Ah I always thought it was odd there were no small windows in any of the rooms on this floor
'This is the real outer wall
Ben said as endorphins flowed into his brain in bounty of an oft asked question

The wall was made of an old brick that was large & thick
The bricks that comprised the earlier build'n were a dark purple like the color of space
_

The tunnel was bare and held no purpose, no back doors to any classrooms
It only contiuned long passage after long passages

The end came up as a blank wall

'The architect must have been a comedian
Ben chirp'd

'Or a way to hide access to an entire level in a closet
Jordan countered

'This bay is huge & was wild
'Pirates used to come here to raid
'Times they had kidnapped children

Ben noticed on the old brick
Symbols carved in peculiar diagrams 
The spraw of it was typical of angry graffiti

'When I got lost I came to the end I found this
Todd's nails scraped against the wall until he found an edge

Jordan moved him out of the way as he went to work with a thin steel bar
The peeled paint revealed a metal door 2ft above the ground 3ft high & wide

Todd took the bar from Jordan and pry'd open the hinges to a creaked & submission
Somehow Todd always knew this went down & now he saw into its hard depths

The door locked from the inside of the vent

Dark musty air flowed immedately to them strong as a gulf breeze
Something caught Todds eye which he poked with the bar

Elevator cords hung in the mid obscured in the darkness
'If there are 3 lower basements then there are two floors to explore

An exchange of glances to agreed compliance
Jordan looked casual 
Ben looked like he would not back down

Todd reached with extended arm and grasped the cord
In a hard pull he let himself be drawn into the darkness

Unexpectedly Todds hands began to slide and he rapidly descended scream'n

!!OHSHIT
_

All was dark that cut off exactly to black
Distance was an abstract measurment

Todd ventured his legs out and managed to stop himself at near splits

!!! TODD
The other two screamed frantically down

'Im okay
'Im okay
Todd said look'n up the only ray of light that emited from the door


'There is oil on the cords
'I should have expected it
'Gonna take off my shirt and use it to hold wrap around my hands for grip

'Do you need help up
Ben asked automatically without idea on how to back up the offer

'Its best only one person be on the cord at the same time
'Im gonna try to find the doors that lead the the lower floors
Todd fearless began to lower himself now at a controlled rate
_

Todd in the commotion did not notice any doors on the way down 
The best course would be to climb up slowly to ensure he could get back up
He would feel for an open'n with this feet

The slide down had cleared off most of the oil
His hands how had clean purchase
The only sound was his breath and the swell of air
The gusts came in intesnse heat from deep darkness

Todd felt a gust on his stomach
It was cool & didn't come from below

He stomped out the outline of the door

!TWANG
A sliver beam bore into the darkness

'I think
'I think I found it

With one hand he felt for a handle
The door was there, he could feel the cold metal

!! POMP !!
!! POMP POMP !!

Todd stomped the corner down 
He pulled himself higher kick'n down until the door gave way
He pulled himeself into the dusty grey hallway

'Im off the cords 
'Come down

'Wrap your shirt around your hands
'I will be here to grab you if you need it

Ben & Jordan followed and swiftly entered
Ben climbed inside scrape'n his knee
Look'n up saw Todd and shrieked

!FUCK

Ben fell back on his ass in the dust

Todd was near completely covered in dusk-caked dark-blood-mud
It had been blood not oil that had been on the cords

Smears were left all over where Todd had touched himself
_

This level was an abandoned hospital
All lay as if it had been unexpectedly sealed off

Dust caked everywhere 
Jordan could easily see their tracks back
They went forward in a cautious adventurous manner

At the end of the first hall Jordan looked into a room
On the bed was a familiar form

'Hold up

Jordan walked inside the room 
Only a bed pan & a flipped-over bed
With a swift fling he threw off the blanked

A long decayed corpse lay there
The smell stung their noses sharply

The horror was simple
No screams or fear of life
Only a complete surety that their life was in danger
_

A loud-clang, shuffle and meaty-wacks where heard 
A hoarse voice immedately was silenced 

The boys took shelter in the room stare'n at the corpse
Its hair over-grown its jaw Dangled stoopidly

They kept waiting after the commotion stopped

Someone was trap'd & beaten in the concealed subbasement of the school
Whoever was run'n the system would no doubt do likewise to the trio of boys

In an abandonded level layers from help  with only one known exit - an elevator shaft
Mousecraft was the sure way to go about these things
Patience & longwait'n until absolute vacancy was established

For the entire period they waited between bells that could be faintly-heard

The room they hid in was hardly worth explore'n
All was strewn around in some odd position of total abandonment
_

With their eyes & senses now accustomed they proceeded
The halls were built in the same structure as their school
One large hall circled the outside classrooms and inside classrooms

All told obvious signs that this path no longer used
Jordan headed their search track'n the dust to know how long since last passage
The inside of the classroom had been the highest-end of  the vacancy-specturm
_

Soon Jordan was on a path that was taken daily
The other end of the path led to a stairwell
The other head they followed to a large open room

Workstations arrayed the entire space

A low-hang-light draped over each stone table 
Rusted rungs were embedded as obvious retraint ports

Below the top were various shelves for various instruments
Jordans heart aun fainted when it became obvious all the tools in all the stations down all the rows had been used recently

There where daily tracks, recent tracks, no tracks 
This room was recently used for massive operations

The only daily path led to a table far at the end with its light on
_

Strapped to the table by a broad-leather-belt was a nude redheaded girl
So bruised was her face it was impossible to see her freckles
Freckles covered Jewels body
Freckled to the point that tho bloody, bruised & nude; all was only the second characteristic noticed

She had stichess from several openings mostly on her torso
Many patches appeared in similar fashion all over her body

Her shut eyes sprang into maniac alertness expose'n large teary-yellow-orbs
Three boys, not monsters, stood over her

'How to we get these loose
Jordan asked her after he was unable to free any strap

Confused near exhasperated
'How the fk do I get these off

Jewels looked back at him and opened a mutilated stump of a tongue 

'Finally sorry 
'I cant speak even breath
A small muffled voice came to fullness

'When you move like that
Infantile hands pushed its way out of the hair to emerge as a shrunken-head with two arms
_

The trio looked agast 
The girl had a shrunked creature attached 

'Yes this is a shock I understand
The little head said in a small voice

Jewels cast her face to the side ashamed
Nude & openly disfigured

The little head made a small exhasperated sound and shrunk under the deflated-skin 
A lump under her skin bulged and moved like a hamster from her shoulder to her throat

'I talked to you earlier by broadcast'n it from her vocal cords
'The bands are one leather belt
'Above our head you can release it 
'Jewels cannot speak & I can't read her mind
'But I can sense what she is feeling
'She feels ashamed of me right now

The lump moved back into the shrunked torso it puppeted
'Jewels hates when I do that
'But we need to get moving

Jordan found the clasp to be an odd shaped clasp that took some ingenuity before it was released
All with the help of the metal bar and 6 arms

Jordans shirt was the least dirty
Jewels wore it as a small dress

'We need to hurry the goons will be back soon
'If we are still subterranean when that happens we will have no chance whatsoever

The shrunked form talked with its hands
The motion of arms excentuated what its voice was limited in express'n
 
Promptly they made exodus from that devilish laboratory room
The light had a cruel elderly tint of an aged desperation 
_

The elevator-cord was clean enoughto allow them all quick access back up to the basement
Not till they reached the closet door did they recognize their perdicament

Todd was smeared over in blood
Jordan was shirtless
All were caked in dust
& Then there was Jewels
