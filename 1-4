The follow'n tales
Are fictional adventure

In Quantum Dimensions
Where tight bonds cross

Sleep'n portals
One makes
For one's other self

Entangled but divergent

Jules
& Her gang

She broke into money
Go'n pro

Tho once in trouble
Downtown that group saved her

Now they were hired on as groupies
Atleast that was the corporate understanding

It was a post storm night
Water like wells
Gape to swallow the unwary
To however deep one goes

Todd Jordan & Ben
After have'n discovered
The Library Lair

Head'n back from the Mart
Laden with supplies

They hear these shreechs
Of tires almost to blaze

Closer & closer
Like a Microtorrent

Until it was upon them
In the blare of headlights

A dark form jumped
It was a lioness

By that means it
Avoided collision of the murder'n bumper

Land'n back into sunlight
The lioness morphed into

Jules stunt'n down
On her bike

That night was very eventful
Short story they got back
To the Library Lair
With only a 6 pack of cokes

There Jules befriended into the gang

Now their Lairs
Where ranches on various parts of America

Often in the same rooms
On her pro tours

Their stress free lives
Abided powerful REM

They built portals
They left SHTF-packs

The blessed aide usually
All one ever hoped for

Tho today
The day that ruined her career

XGames dure'n her performace
A bloody version of her
Burst onto the set
Jules kept her cool
But it was on National TV

Bloody Jules gave her a roll
As she was taken as a hysterical to the hospital

Today they would roll
To break her out

'A sith knight has been hunter
'To many dead versions

One can go only
To one of 3 states
Light Twilight Dark

These orders keep
To themselves

But there was a rogue assasin
Have'n never failed a hit

+
Circle Gates
& Gram Geometrics
With great effort
One summons aide
From another gate

Alchemistic nonreproducive monsters
From small to large animals

Herbs & Spice Smoke
Chants chants chants
For that 20min window

Rats, bunnies, cats
Sacrificed to be vessels

Mutated by the ceremony
Into a monster like being

# 2 #######################
(( KITTY WITCH ))

Todd's mother was targeted
By a swarm of cat monsters

Poisoned claws & coordinated
In packs attacked one night

All had been in the back
When the storm came upon them

Windows all blown in
These leatherly cats intruded

Jordan was the forefront
His crow bar hooked
The cats easy to bash

To even more horror
To frightened family

The bastards were swiftly beaten back
Ben told them to follow

The cats each taking individual paths
Thru the suburbs towards the cemetery

The gang followed easy enough
As one or two was only ever needed

They raced down hill on them
Curb'n them towards the cemetery

The cats in a disordered pack
Gathered to ambush Ben the lead

He threw his bike
Over the cemetery fence
He was just to scale over

The cats were on him as soon
As he landed thru
& The other three arrived
Ben rolled into one pulverize'n
Into the asphalt
The close quarters only
Allowed him the use of the butt
Bashing at the first two on him

Like a swarm
They clawed viciously onto him

Jordan rammed full speed
Smashing the felines into Ben into the ground

The remaining cats retreated
9 Cats in gory massacre

Thru the city ten miles
The cats were run into an
Overgrown patch of neighborhood

That stalemated the cats into rest

Ben's wounds were not easy to treat
All the water was used

The claws had been dirty black
Sticky like tar it burned
Until it was purged completely

4am The pursuit continued
Drive'n them in herd
Back to the source
That summoned them

Into the dunes & wastelands
2mi of have'n to hike over

All knew
Quantum connected
That this is the path
They must see thru
At whatever cost

Two fences into the land
Bones of animals
Fecal matter in piles
Sour pools of water
Foul animals abunantly

An emmensive ticket barrier
Walled in a sigular hut
Large but made in aboriginal ways

A sinister shriek
Torn into their bones

Jordan & Todd
Bore down the giant door

Its ancient fibers
Burst readily down
Into clouds that
Immedately met the intruders

The group closely
The all went into a dim
As if a great light snuffed out

Moonbeams unhindered illuminated
A great hearth & cauldron

Vacumms of smoke
Bloomed where a
Quick form
Darted to & fro

They rushed all forward
But were met with bruises against the tables

To the point they had
To reveal themslves with their lights

Immediately proven the worst idea
As a clay jar was flung bursting
On their bikes into a foul pepper cloud
Choke'n all but Jules

Dart'n bike first
To the source

The collision to Jules
Into a bloated haggardly corpse
Shit was blew out with great pressure
In a blind strike
Jules embedded the tomahawk
Into the putrid cheek bone
Cave'n into moldy brain tissue

The mile passed forgotten
To the murky waters
Of the Nueces
They dove into caked completely
The water around dark purple
The lingered unabated for over 10min

Cool'n off
In the dawnlight
Pant'n in the mud
Push'n off reeds
Kick'n away frogs

Dawn light led them
Back to the hut
Thru all fences
Each patchwork & easily bypassed

All only a dark brown
Within the thicket of this vile land

Inside the great hut
They saw the last remnants
Of the foul bloated thing
Carried off by various critters

Bones of children
Bones of men
Countless full sets
Adorne'n the bed
The filthy mat
Its stench stung nostrils
From very far away

Ancient hand written books
Were at hand every where

Always next to a half done mix
Dry, powder, or mud

Two distinguishable manners of craft
One dark purple & vile
Other pale green yellow
That gave off an earthly smell

The balm of it
Immediately curing
On their nostrils

Altars were set up in
Sporatic locations

A scroll strewn
Like a weep'n body
Under a dismembered corpse
Most were mostly ashe
But still many were exposed rot


# 3 #############################
Jules & Jordan stayed back
As the others left
To try & settle with Todd's family

Jules had argued
'The location here is private
'& Accessible to the city or the beach

The bayward thicket had a recess
On its outer sides which afforded
Most all locations for gusts
The two labored
To Set it up as a base

By midday supply-laden boys
Rode into the recess called the Cove

Over many years
A irrigation trough was dug
Which afforded fresh water
Enter'n the thicket
To leave darkwater
& Fill the mirky pools below towards the road

Todd admited the place
Did readily prove safe
The thorny thicket too dense
For aun fieldmice

Camp by tarps
Strewn like rocks across the stream

In rain they would hope from under one
To under another like mushroom people

Jules had already set way
From that first day

To build a deep pond
To lengthen the cycle of water

School-less job-less
Quick & sturdy work was made every day


# 4 #############################
Industrial Lair
    Towards San Antonio
Library Lair
    Downtown
Cove Lair
    10mi North
+
+
+
They always kept to pairs
Jules & Someone
Off on the tour

The other pair
Off on what they did together

Ben - Todd
Library Lair

Jordan
Industrial Lair

Jules
Cove Lair

As if innately
Cove Lair became their headquarters

The fresh ocean virgin breezes
Irrigation water filtered & used

Raw -> Pool -> Filters -> Fresh stream -> Pools
Herbs were farmed
Using the seed of the old witch

Jules in zealous earnest
Kept the work of the witch

But the witch was dead
So the boys appeased

# END  ###################
In this way
All are warned

The witch is appear'n to Jules
In the form dure'n quests in dreams
In times of need
Entice'n Jules to greater understand'n

The message
' Once revived the witch will kill Jules

Jules couldn't ignore this
They were headed to free the Jules
& All would be revealed
