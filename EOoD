###### ESOTERIC ORDER of DAGON

~ A story of cosmic ~
~ Quantum portal hack'n ~


Clank clak clik
Todd ran his hand down lockers line'n empty halls

15 Minutes now the point of no return

`Devil has idle hands when works harvest
Todd inspired himself to no avail

Aun compel'd to do opposite
The thump of todds feet now 
Step after step up stairs to higher floors
_

The mellow ambiences shattered
As patters of run'n feet charged towards his direction from around the corner

Fortune had placed Todd directly opposite
Of the girls restroom

Todd leapt the distance rush'n inside the last stall
The cracked seat hing broke, but he caught his balance
Feet pivot'n on the grimy rim
_

The door quietly was opened and someone made an attempt to open the first stall

A muffled yell came from still far away
'BEN WE KNOW YOUR IN THE GIRLS

Heavy legs near kicked the hinges off in an over ambitious action
!! BOOM !!

As a small spark explodes the whole a volcano burst

!!! BRAPPPPPPPPPPUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSSPPPPUUUPPPPTTTTTUUUUPPPPP !!!

The entire school vibrated with its echo

!!! GAWDDAMN BEN YOU SHOULDA SEID WHY YOU NEED THE GIRLS 
One of the schoolhall monitors hooted out for the entire school

The last of this announcement was gagged out as the gas particles bloomed out as thick cloud
_

The room was silent still after the door fell shut and resettled.

!! PAT !!
!! PAT PAT !!
'Gonna make your fat cunt ass eat that shit you bich
Ben kicked at the stall now braced shut by legs

'Back off
Todd step'd out of the stall

Ben turned to him even more crazed
'You! You are the reason I got chased

Todd was tackled to the wall

-walk'n around
-like you not ditch'n class
Ben muffled as he struggled out his revenge

Todd manuevered around use'n Bens force against him
Then with his forarms place'n Ben in a locked hold 
_

After several curses and a long pause
'Alright asshole you made your point

Todd pushed him off to a safe distance

The toilet flushed and another boy joined the scene in the girls restroom

'Sorry about that Im sick
Jordan blushed out the awkward introduction

They all knew that morn was go'n to haunt Ben a long time
For a while they were content with breathe'n the gas locked in their with them
_

The was were stained a red too deep to be pink but washed white.
Piss marked all to a feminine territory

Curiosity only met horrors to the boys never have'n been inside

'This place is kinda creepy
Ben broke the silence after all of them had been repelled to investigations
Stuck here with no where to go until the class period ended

'Agreed
Todd mediated in
'There is a hum that sounds like a whimper
Todd drew nearer to the vent that was stained as a dump for feminitity

'Probably this school is hella haunted
Jordan put in authoritatively

Suddenly Todd spoke into the vent
'We can hear you

A constant hum is only revealed as truth when silenced
_

( need help help please help )

The whimper so faint Todd looked for confirmation to the other two
Who had instantly drawn themselves nearer to the source

( help me    please )

'Here      we are here
'Where are you

( below     can you hear me  hello please help )

'We hear you
'We will get the Principal

[ noooooooooooo ! ]
The shriek took all three back in a tight terror

[ they did this to me! ]

After strength was regained from the drained experience Todd responed:
'How can we help get you out

( i dont know      been trapped so long below )
( they keep me drug'd in school hours but I was woken )
( normally it is too loud no one has heard me )

'Who ever you are
Todd said firmly
'Where eer you are
'We will find you
'That is a promise

Todd left immediately with the others follow'n dazed but directly
Only sure that there was no concieveable direction from which to start
To keep what seemed a reckless promise

At 10 min to the bell the hall as most empty
No one allowed to leave at that short notice

The trio made their way now sure of no obstruction

'I discovered this door in a school project
'All year I been try'n to work myself into open'n it

The door was hard to explain and Todd felt the idea
It would be best explained in front of it

They followed the stairwells down
Crossed lengths of halls of the first year students

'When I was first year I got lost 
'I heard some noises the ripped up some paint 
'That broke open a concealed metal door
Todd prepared them for what he was about to explain
Set'n the stage as the door was neared

'Does it go down
'I did research on this school for all my papers
'This floor is suposed to be the basement
'There was one article of one of the earliest cases
'A boy was found brutally seperated in a satanic ritual
'The article said the incident was found 
'In the controversial 3rd floor of the basement
'That could be considered a typo becuase there is only one basement
'But there was no third floor when University Hospital was built on top of the school

((After a hurricane this school was the only edifice intact and it was chosen as the foundation of the worlds leading university on transplants & extreme studies))

When Jordan spoke his content was near a rant
Hard thought ideas nurtured into a certain form
_

The exterior wall held a corner closet
Todd tried it but his sweaty palms on the slide on the locked knob

'Let me get this
Jordan knelt in front, took off his pack, and retrieved a pouch

The door was open and pack on Jordans back before the other two could follow 
_

A narrow closet exposed by the small window was revealed a narrow corridor which followed the exterior wall

'Ah I always thought it was odd there were no small windows in any of the rooms
'This is the real outer wall
Ben said as endorphins flowed into his brain as bounty of an oft asked question
_

The tunnel was bare and held no purpose, no back doors to any classrooms, only a way to a single end

The end finally came up as a blank wall
'When I got lost I came to the end I found this
'I dont remember how
Todd added as his nails scraped against the wall until he found the edge

Jordan moved him out of the way as he went to work with a thin but strong steel bar

The peeled off paint revealed a metal door 2ft above the ground 3ft high & wide

'I knew one day I be able to get around the Monitors and get back to this floor to open this
Todd took the bar from Jordan and pry'd open the hinges to a creak & submission

Dark musty air flowed immedately to them strong as a gulf breeze
Something caught Todds eye which he poked with the bar

A elevator cords rand the distance

'If there are 3 lower basements that means there are two floors to explore to find that girl

After an exchange of glances 
Jordan look casual & Ben looked like he would not allow a back down

Todd reached with extended arm and grasped the cord, pulled hard, and let himself be drawn into the darkness

Unexpectedly Todds hands began to slide and he rapidly descended scream'n
_

All was dark he could be rapidly descend'n down a tunnel with infinite sides as far as he could make out
He ventured his legs out and managed to stop himself at near splits

!!! TODD
The other two screamed frantically down

'Im okay    Im okay
Todd said look'n up the only ray of light that emited from the door

'There is oil on the cords, but my legs are achored
'Gonna take off my shirt and use it to hold wrap around my hands for grip

'Do you need help up
Ben asked automatically without idea on how to back up the offer

'Its best only one person be on the cord at the same time
'Im gonna try to find the doors that lead the the lower floors
Todd fearless began to lower himself now at a controlled rate
_

The distance seemed far to the other two and Todd in the commotion didnt look for any doors in between
The best course would be to climb up slowly to ensure he could get back up, which he was still unsure was possible, and also look for a door in the slow pull

The slide down had cleared off most of the oil which was odd
The only sound was his breath and the swell of air

Near a third way back up Todd imagined a sound which too full form in the distance up
He climbed his feet walk'n up the walk and in that motion feel'n for a door

His foot stub'd against an uneven ledge and the faint shrieks became full-bodied
'I think    I think I found it
He shouted out to the two ceaseless in gaze'n into the abyss

With one hand he felt for a handle, the door was there, he could feel the cold metal
The door had no interior handle

!! POMP !!
!! POMP POMP !!

Todd use'n both feet stomped on it until a corner broke outward to a overbear'n beam of light
He pulled himself higher and kicked down on the door force'n it lowered

'Come down but wrap your shirt around your heads not to slide
'I will be here to grab you if you need it

Ben & Jordan followed and swiftly entered
Then the three took the time to look at Todd

He was near completely covered in dusk caked dark blood
It had been blood not oil that had been on the cords

Smears were left all over where Todd had touched himself
_

Todd finished dry heave'n down the elevator shaft
He turned to see what the other two where mezmerized by but none heretofore had time to see

This lower level was a run down dimly lit hospital
The shrieks were heard now hoarse

A loud clang shuffle and wacks where heard with yell'n
The voice immedately was silenced

The boys had taken shelter in an abandoned room
Wait'n for the commotion to settle down in order to proceed with the promise

Someone was trap'd & beaten in the concealed subbasement of the school
Whoever was run'n the system would no doubt win against the ignorant trio

For the entire period they waited between bells that could still be faintly heard

The room they hid in was hardly worth explore'n
All was open bare cast in some odd position of total abandonment
_

With their eyes and senses now accustomed they proceeded
The halls were built their the school, one large hall circled the outside classrooms and inside classrooms

The place betrayed obvious signs that this paths no longer used
Jordan headed their search track'n in the dust to know how long since use
The inside of the classroom had been the highest end of vacancy in the specturm
_

Soon Jordan was on a path that was taken daily
One heads of the path led to a stairwell
The other head they followed to a large open room

Setups like workstations arrayed the entire space

A low hang'n light over a stone table 
Rusted rungs were imbed'd as obvious retraint ports

Below the top were various shelves for various instruments
Jordans heart aun fainted terror when it became obvious all the tools in all the stations down all the rows had been used recently

There where daily tracks, recent tracks, no tracks as category for Jordans track'n which betrayed this rythmn of movement
This room was at times used for massive operation

Daily tracks the only path that led to a table far at the end with the only light on
_

Strapped to the table by leather cuffs was a nude redheaded girl
So bruised was her face that one could only assume she was freckle faced
As the rest of Jewels body
Freckled to the point that tho blood, aged & new, was only the second characteristic noticed

She had stichess from where she was opened
Many such patches were seen in similar fashion

Her eyes shut & teary burst out yellow orbs out of buldge'n eyes
Three boys not monsters, stood over her

'How to we get these loose
Jordan asked her as he was unable to free any strap

Confused near exhasperated
'How the fk do I get these off

Jewels looked back at him and opened a mutilated stump of a tongue 

'Finally sorry I can't speak even breath
'When you move like that
Infantile hands mades its way out of the hair to emerge a shrunked older head
_

The trio looked agast at a girl who had a shrunked head attached

'Yes this is a shock I understand
The little head said in a small voice

Jewels cast her face to the side ashamed, not only nude but as openly disfigured

The little head made a small exhasperated sound and moved into itself
A lump bulged and moved like a hamster under her skin from her shoulder to her throat

'I talked to you earlier by broadcast'n it from her vocal cords
'The bands are one leather belt    Above our head you can release it 

Jordan found the clasp to be an odd shaped clasp that took some ingenuity before it was released
Also with help of the metal bar and 6 arms

Jordans who shirt was mostly non bloody as being the last to descend handed Jewels his shirt
'We need to hurry the goons will be back soon
'If we are still subterranean when that happens we have no chance whatsoever

The shrunked form like to talk with its hands using the motion of its arms to excentuate what its voice was limited in express'n
 
Jordans shirt was large enough to cover all of Jewels sensitive parts
Promptly they made exodus from that devilish laboratory room
The walls of the place vibrate'n with unspoken legions of torment
_

The cord was now clean to allow them all quick access back up to the basement
Not till they reached the closet door did they recognize their perdicament

Todd was smeared over in blood, Jordan was shirtless
All were caked in dust
Jewels too much to mention

The school had ceaseless Monitored that roamed the halls to keep certain students on certain floors
In advent of see'n them the Monitors would be on them before they could breach the grounds

'We will have to wait for Last Bell
Jordan said assured in an authorative tone

'No no no that will be our undo'n
'Literally we will be crushed for this in mere minutes from when we are discovered gone
'This whole area was structured for that purpose alone

======================================================================

Dusty shirtless pantless bloody
They broke into the hall as cast from a horror scene into a monotony of regular moods that made the view more contrast to one who spot'd

Todd had the plan in his mind for long time of the quickest route of exit
They made it to the end of the hall in the basement before a teacher opened the door and yelled
!!! MONITOR

The call for all students to plaster at the windows
The four spectacted as they turned the corner to rush up the stair well

From their exit down the hall was the front exit
Two large Monitors stood as sentinels lock'n down protocol

!!! MONITORS
They in unison boomed unrelent'n to keep vigil at the exit

Todd was already lead'n them to the other stairwells across the level 
The shouts already at their backs

There was no time to explain only for Todd to choose and the rest to follow
_

Every window was filled & door blocked by curious children stir'd by the shouts
The teachers were in that way bar'd to even look to the halls

This the factor that allowed them to get to the second floor unhindered
They passed the restroom of the morn to the end of the hall

'Just do what I do and go where I go
He took out a key from his pocket & unlocked the window

They climbed onto a narrow ledge outside
The sun shone hotly on them already burn'n with exhaustion

The world around them too busy with their day to notice four odd bodies in Downtown
Their exit was seen by classmates but it would be time before this was transmitted to the Monitors
_

The ledge continued to an adjacent roof which they crossed to a high brached tree
The large branch invaded onto the build'n to a rooted attachment

By that means they climbed to the lower level at the back of the school
Alley to all edificies where only the garbabge collectors or dark dealers frequented 

Jewels only had a large shirt & Ben's sweaty socks
The large city bustlers went their way without heed as the four moved in a pack follow'n Jordan

They arrived at the edge of the district that broke into an industrial sector for the port
Jordan turned them into an alley & thru a open'n in the chain-linked-fence that Jordan loosed then replaced as they entered

Thru a locked window they quickly entered
_

The edifice was as dusty as the basement
They cautiously followed Jordans movements hop'n from board to board their trace without tracks up the stairs to a room
Jordan Locked the room with a chain & pushed away a cabinet to reveal a door also locked

There was a outside window that even exposed only did so to the open ocean
Dust free & ocean breeze Jordan led them thru the window to a ledge that was covered but of net'd metal

'I got a tank that collect rain water
'Open it & close it with this knob
He motioned them to turn around

He took a brisk wash
The water fell with distance splashed far below this area once a fire exit, but the stairs were chained up

'You love padlocks huh
Ben said at Jordan as he dried
'So what is this you clubhouse for these exact situations?

Jordan looked down as his face blushed
'This is one of the places I go to live

They showered with Todd last as he was so bloody
_

Refreshed & completely exhausted lay'n on layers of worked-cardboard to sleep on
Ocean gusts assuaged them all to deep sleep until Saturday

Jordan fed them dried fruit & granola that finished with a Mtn-Dew
'I got locations like this all over the city
'Each of them has a stash of all I need
'But I was stuck across towns and ate bad food I stashed there from a while back

'A hot summer
Ben said still bitter from now become permanent clown at the school

'Your parents should be freak'n out

!fk
Ben then realized his perdicament with this father
He was look'n forward to a self-righteous beat'n which are by far worse than the normal ones his father dishes
_

'Take everything I never go to the same place in the same week
Ben needed to get to the payphone back at the lower district
Jordan trailed them cover'n their tracks as they returned to the streets

The day was still early but warm'n to a hot day which would help their overworked bodies and stiff sleep

'I am the last of the litter with the room at the very end
'My parents wouldn't know if I was gone for a week

Jordan had a rummage of a trove at that place
Jewels was decked out head to toe with garments that mostly fit

The shrunken head kept silent know'n how much its presence pained Jewels
The press'n pace of life had left this baggage to be sorted out when time allowed

After 4 rings Ben tried the asshole oldman next over
'Heeh Hello
The old voice responded

'Mr. Grinvix this is Ben from next door
Ben said into the phone wait'n for sometime

'I just wanted to call to ask about my dad
'He isn't answer'n the phone

Ben waited awkwardly as there was only the sound of heavy breath'n

'Your dad is dead boy
'You best get to the authorities an have em tell ya
The voice was sympathetic but immediately hung up after the message was given

Ben stood silent phone to his ear
Flabbergasted from a truth revealed lie
He always knew his dad would be there
& Now he is not there
His whole being worked to come to grips as understand'n toppled down
_

!!! PLUUPP PLUPP !!!
A police car had silently snuck up behind the crew
Its lights now bright at their backs

'Alright you ju 
The cop cut short as the pack immediately bolted

He turned and fumbled into the door he had preemptively shut
Today was not the mood to be disrespected by children

'XO I got a 281 on that 48f
'Update the 48f is now a 49f

He reversed sirens blare'n not needed to give look a heed
In that action he was then fused with a pole as a overworked trucker plowed him to his death
_

Todd looked back in relief at the horrible accident
That cop was unquestionably the result of Ben contact'n his neighbor

What was this all about?
Did it have to do with Ben or what this a result of yesterday?

======================================================================

Todd led the exhausted group up the hills towards his home 
Ben had no said a word but his contenance exposed the truth

If this was about Ben it would be known 
Or if this is about yesterday his own life would likewise be shattered

Vital group comunicates can not be contained into words
A synchronized group says less and do more

Complain'n about the strain only weighs others down
& In the midst of a journey the strain is the general feel'n

The deep sleep of last night swept away traceless 
Only the entreched feel'n of a labor with no timely solution
Only the acceptance of pain as a state of being

The five miles drew two hours time
Heat'n day to full on sun under cloudless sky

Seagulls squaked at them as if enjoy'n their uncomfortable situation in the jealous envy typical of gulls
The world continued careless in their cars disconnected from their temporary coordinates
Distracted by the thought of the distination or deportaion

The four souls suffer'n & unable to begin to voice the matters at hand
Their own souls a full capacity try'n to come to grips with the present

The girl a freak whose utter truths laid bare under long presence
Before a set of strangers who on happenstance saved her & the miss

'My name is Miss
Jules broke the silence allow'n Miss to speak
_

The communication took time to digest
After the miles & silence of misery

Miss paitently continued
'I have been attached by operation  
'To this girl Jewels who was offered
'As sacrifice by her guardians to Dagon

The fantasic words to the drum & hum of day-to-day bustle that is life
Their worlds set in revolutions 60M times a second

Yet all seem so normal
As if the world around testifies
Whatever is go'n on is just day-to-day bullshit
--Let us keep it move'n

'Dagon is a cosmic god
'Earth is bribed to him
'As an occult offer'n
'In exchange for the bounty
'To which the god bestows
'After the feast of a meal

'All this he will swallow
'To drain dry as Mars

'Great powers lie as the foundations of this cult
'The promise is of omni powers uncalculable 

'Some envision an infinite life
'Indesuptably to be as god themself

'I am one of those in faith of Dagon
'All worth in exchange for a god's blessing

'Jewels was the daughter of a wealthy family
'To pay the price of a family to enter
'The prime of their seed must be exchanged

'I am 400 years old
'The symbyotic body of this girl now sustains me

'As payment into the order the past must live as the youth
'But don't you get this confused I offer much

'I heal her and repair her myself surgeon centries in experience
'I guarntee her life till old age as a promise

The arms of this creature now see as stilts puppeted
The core of it a brain shrunk to that of a squirell
The mass moved in a manmade skull the size of a golfball free to move in diffferent parts of Jewels body as stations
The right shoulder is Miss perch for when she talks caz she talks with the arms puppeted by latent muscles

'We worship the bowels of Dagon
'In her is inserted divine microbials
'This the digestion of the gods

'These sentient beings enhanced pure to worship the well being of the host as life itself
'From that sense I myself was of the first generation to live longer on hosts
'All work for the betterment of the whole which is Jewels
'I would proclaim she owes us much but she is a foolish girl with tears

'Yes she is foolish myself always busy patch'n up what she self inflicts

'Tho I am not sympathtic to her need to be kept un updated to a modular fashion
'The inner courts ordered her to be pieced into a more streamlined being
'The operation was for Saturday 
'All the surgeons were away for the a worldwide conference

All the boys the had a naw'n thought
'I am sympathetic to her, Jewels, who is held by us as a priestess
'Name annointed Jewels by the Seer who fated her to rise above the most high

'The freckles that she holds on her body are themself constellations
'To the coordinates for the universe that has worked out the best in every situation

'The Seer will seek her out because she is the map that leads us to that universe after the boon of Dagon
'The freckles change as echoes to the quantum world
'Understand this - her future has such consequence fate has map'd upon her the everchange'n direction of where to go

'Only by Dagon is this possible and with the bounty inevitable 

'Miss has been entrusted with this duty myself her humble overseer tho slave you may think she be
_

Miss stayed herself a while for Jewels to regain strength and the jobs was no easy task for miss to talk while walk'n

'The Esoteric Order of Dagon dates to our earliest history and is defcato the oldest creed of all
'Trends have taken its symbolism to idolitary all without substance

'The image of the lord Dagon is alone necessary to weild unobstructed power as the molecules themself bow to His domain

'I myself am a prophetess ordained by the Seer of whom is secretly entitled to follow as I may
'The thunder of your friend woke us to crys loud enough to reach the depths
'Providence appeared you before us to show us the path out of the system 

'Knights & heroes pale to the deeds which you have yesterday all fulfilled
'

The sun only an hour before noon
Silence followed the statement of Miss given with the surety

Find'n it a surprise to find that there was movement in his house
To defy the prophecy of Miss entirely


Not till after Todd entered the gate did he hear disturb'n sounds
The franctic followups between smashed revealed more than mere accident

Todd bore in head first into an immediate scene of mental chaos

Cats were everywhere in feline frenzy
A large one immediately charged for an attacked
Todd had two smart on it with a kick
Of the 10 cats that moved towards them in the attack
None of them cared much to risk in same fate of their leader

It a goolike mash upon the walls
Which in any other circumstance'd make them drool saliva, truly an event for the age

Several were on his mother frantic on the couch
With a justice that can only be filled with rigtheousness Todd clear out the house

His parents now foam'n at the mouth claw'n at the puss foam'n at each scratch
They were past dead & tears when the last of the cats caught in his grasps

Bathed in warm guts as he would use his might to break them legs to legs above his head their belly burst
This act would have all other cats in a lunacy to avoid the same fate

Cats always take too long to do anything aun to their demise
10s of bodies already litered the home as if a massive dog was unleashed with reason not mercy

Yet the tail end of near 100 cats led in mass in the same direction
_

Over short distance the cat is fast but over the distance mankind reigns supreme
Aun to naps the cats will be put off guard by the scent of the approach'n pack

The four over fence, thru yards, along country road, over cemeteries
Until finally rocky bays of ocean water rock to rock at an elevated mass of rock
The Cats with agility climbed up but still Todd much faster

The cats from boulder to boulder jummped defy'n the utter death of a mistake
Only one entry to a thicket walled bay Todd climbed up bleed'n from barnacled summits

A twist'n narrow tunnel opened up into a vast expanse 
Antiquated farm equipment animals of a startle'n variety all went around fire stained pits
One solitary hut built large as a warehouse loomed in the center

Tatched to sustain hurricane winds the edifice a concrete foundation
Bedrock to a large layer of sand  

A large bonfire pit in the center of the circular lot the center open two times larger
The whole was engeineer with a genius
If strong winds blow to hard the structure can reel up its barrier to be easily extended later

As the cat with the first warn'n returned with message
It was tailed by Todd himself as if that message only to introduce them
For that old woman to suffer a much more terrible fate

The cats would not near the area, and that is how the other three found their friend
Off to himself and they themselves overly content with rest'n 

Jewels stomached her way around the witch's hut
Parts of the witch were so scattered such that she hoped the reason to be of the cats
Take'n last pick at a pick'n

Leatherbound Tomes laid up balcony structures that held a pit in center with a iorn inlay pole to hook up a cauldroun
Jewels spent her time in the study of these and the deduction of the items still remain'n in each pit
_

There was no where to go but where they were
The supply of the witch would last them years

A water from a resivoir the size of a pond kept clean a source
Firewood came pentiful with the ocean drifts

Three weeks went by with even less words between them
All had lost much & only Jewels came out on top

As if ordained with the method of ones soul
Jewels absorbed herself into learn'n the ways of the witch

Jordan spent his time explore'n & admire'n the excellent situation of the island
This base would prove his most beloved 
Built from foundation to be off the grid but preserve'n arguably better utilities

A sandy cliff of ones own to drop off to ocean waters that moved in predicatble ways
One leap would exfoliate ones skin in a deep cleanse
_

Ben & Todd in similar circumstance
Understood each other as entirely divergent as their reactions conflicted

There was a global power that aimed to get them at whatever cost
To send cat assassins crafted by wiccan conjury of which Jewels with the aid of Miss abstracted

Jewels created her tome larger than four textboots in rectangle
In one large wooden shield The iron that bound sturdy wear resistant leather pages

The leather made from the thin flesh of dead cats
Of which due to Todd was in lifetime abundance
That cats revere'n Todd like an awesome diety
Tho all the others they favored gratuitously in a way of one redeemed to a good master
_

Day after day the testimony that all is only just another day
This the song of every bay its exiestence at times only seasons

Todd & Ben both well healed in time
With that careful slow heal'n in a healthy way 
In that way form a resilient seal to use it as battery from which to draw energy on daily basis

Ben have'n only the unix kernel & internel manpages from a solar powered onsite station
Todd in his day long meditations on core new meanings now exposed
Jordan lived in utter peace as if time finally paid back from ever turbid ages

Jewels armed as was Arthur of The Knights of the Round Table
Her shield a tome like a sceptere the mass of it a shrine to her newfound way
Miss ever diligent to guide and grow her talents into abilities
