###### ESOTERIC ORDER of DAGON

~ A story of cosmic ~
~ Quantum portal hack'n ~


Clank clak clik
Todd ran his hand down lockers line'n empty halls

15 Minutes now the point of no return

`Devil has idle hands when works harvest
Todd inspired himself to no avail

Aun compel'd to do opposite
The thump of todds feet now 
Step after step up stairs to higher floors
_

The mellow ambiences shattered
As patters of run'n feet charged towards his direction from around the corner

Fortune had placed Todd directly opposite
Of the girls restroom

Todd leapt the distance rush'n inside the last stall
The cracked seat hing broke, but he caught his balance
Feet pivot'n on the grimy rim
_

The door quietly was opened and someone made an attempt to open the first stall

A muffled yell came from still far away
'BEN WE KNOW YOUR IN THE GIRLS

Heavy legs near kicked the hinges off in an over ambitious action
!! BOOM !!

As a small spark explodes the whole a volcano burst

!!! BRAPPPPPPPPPPUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSSPPPPUUUPPPPTTTTTUUUUPPPPP !!!

The entire school vibrated with its echo

!!! GAWDDAMN BEN YOU SHOULDA SEID WHY YOU NEED THE GIRLS 
One of the schoolhall monitors hooted out for the entire school

The last of this announcement was gagged out as the gas particles bloomed out as thick cloud
_

The room was silent still after the door fell shut and resettled.

!! PAT !!
!! PAT PAT !!
'Gonna make your fat cunt ass eat that shit you bich
Ben kicked at the stall now braced shut by legs

'Back off
Todd step'd out of the stall

Ben turned to him even more crazed
'You! You are the reason I got chased

Todd was tackled to the wall

-walk'n around
-like you not ditch'n class
Ben muffled as he struggled out his revenge

Todd manuevered around use'n Bens force against him
Then with his forarms place'n Ben in a locked hold 
_

After several curses and a long pause
'Alright asshole you made your point

Todd pushed him off to a safe distance

The toilet flushed and another boy joined the scene in the girls restroom

'Sorry about that Im sick
Jordan blushed out the awkward introduction

They all knew that morn was go'n to haunt Ben a long time
For a while they were content with breathe'n the gas locked in their with them
_

The was were stained a red too deep to be pink but washed white.
Piss marked all to a feminine territory

Curiosity only met horrors to the boys never have'n been inside

'This place is kinda creepy
Ben broke the silence after all of them had been repelled to investigations
Stuck here with no where to go until the class period ended

'Agreed
Todd mediated in
'There is a hum that sounds like a whimper
Todd drew nearer to the vent that was stained as a dump for feminitity

'Probably this school is hella haunted
Jordan put in authoritatively

Suddenly Todd spoke into the vent
'We can hear you

A constant hum is only revealed as truth when silenced
_

( need help help please help )

The whimper so faint Todd looked for confirmation to the other two
Who had instantly drawn themselves nearer to the source

( help me    please )

'Here      we are here
'Where are you

( below     can you hear me  hello please help )

'We hear you
'We will get the Principal

[ noooooooooooo ! ]
The shriek took all three back in a tight terror

[ they did this to me! ]

After strength was regained from the drained experience Todd responed:
'How can we help get you out

( i dont know      been trapped so long below )
( they keep me drug'd in school hours but I was woken )
( normally it is too loud no one has heard me )

'Who ever you are
Todd said firmly
'Where eer you are
'We will find you
'That is a promise

Todd left immediately with the others follow'n dazed but directly
Only sure that there was no concieveable direction from which to start
To keep what seemed a reckless promise

At 10 min to the bell the hall as most empty
No one allowed to leave at that short notice

The trio made their way now sure of no obstruction

'I discovered this door in a school project
'All year I been try'n to work myself into open'n it

The door was hard to explain and Todd felt the idea
It would be best explained in front of it

They followed the stairwells down
Crossed lengths of halls of the first year students

'When I was first year I got lost 
'I heard some noises the ripped up some paint 
'That broke open a concealed metal door
Todd prepared them for what he was about to explain
Set'n the stage as the door was neared

'Does it go down
'I did research on this school for all my papers
'This floor is suposed to be the basement
'There was one article of one of the earliest cases
'A boy was found brutally seperated in a satanic ritual
'The article said the incident was found 
'In the controversial 3rd floor of the basement
'That could be considered a typo becuase there is only one basement
'But there was no third floor when University Hospital was built on top of the school

((After a hurricane this school was the only edifice intact and it was chosen as the foundation of the worlds leading university on transplants & extreme studies))

When Jordan spoke his content was near a rant
Hard thought ideas nurtured into a certain form
_

The exterior wall held a corner closet
Todd tried it but his sweaty palms on the slide on the locked knob

'Let me get this
Jordan knelt in front, took off his pack, and retrieved a pouch

The door was open and pack on Jordans back before the other two could follow 
_

A narrow closet exposed by the small window was revealed a narrow corridor which followed the exterior wall

'Ah I always thought it was odd there were no small windows in any of the rooms
'This is the real outer wall
Ben said as endorphins flowed into his brain as bounty of an oft asked question
_

The tunnel was bare and held no purpose, no back doors to any classrooms, only a way to a single end

The end finally came up as a blank wall
'When I got lost I came to the end I found this
'I dont remember how
Todd added as his nails scraped against the wall until he found the edge

Jordan moved him out of the way as he went to work with a thin but strong steel bar

The peeled off paint revealed a metal door 2ft above the ground 3ft high & wide

'I knew one day I be able to get around the Monitors and get back to this floor to open this
Todd took the bar from Jordan and pry'd open the hinges to a creak & submission

Dark musty air flowed immedately to them strong as a gulf breeze
Something caught Todds eye which he poked with the bar

A elevator cords rand the distance

'If there are 3 lower basements that means there are two floors to explore to find that girl

After an exchange of glances 
Jordan look casual & Ben looked like he would not allow a back down

Todd reached with extended arm and grasped the cord, pulled hard, and let himself be drawn into the darkness

Unexpectedly Todds hands began to slide and he rapidly descended scream'n
_

All was dark he could be rapidly descend'n down a tunnel with infinite sides as far as he could make out
He ventured his legs out and managed to stop himself at near splits

!!! TODD
The other two screamed frantically down

'Im okay    Im okay
Todd said look'n up the only ray of light that emited from the door

'There is oil on the cords, but my legs are achored
'Gonna take off my shirt and use it to hold wrap around my hands for grip

'Do you need help up
Ben asked automatically without idea on how to back up the offer

'Its best only one person be on the cord at the same time
'Im gonna try to find the doors that lead the the lower floors
Todd fearless began to lower himself now at a controlled rate
_

The distance seemed far to the other two and Todd in the commotion didnt look for any doors in between
The best course would be to climb up slowly to ensure he could get back up, which he was still unsure was possible, and also look for a door in the slow pull

The slide down had cleared off most of the oil which was odd
The only sound was his breath and the swell of air

Near a third way back up Todd imagined a sound which too full form in the distance up
He climbed his feet walk'n up the walk and in that motion feel'n for a door

His foot stub'd against an uneven ledge and the faint shrieks became full-bodied
'I think    I think I found it
He shouted out to the two ceaseless in gaze'n into the abyss

With one hand he felt for a handle, the door was there, he could feel the cold metal
The door had no interior handle

!! POMP !!
!! POMP POMP !!

Todd use'n both feet stomped on it until a corner broke outward to a overbear'n beam of light
He pulled himself higher and kicked down on the door force'n it lowered

'Come down but wrap your shirt around your heads not to slide
'I will be here to grab you if you need it

Ben & Jordan followed and swiftly entered
Then the three took the time to look at Todd

He was near completely covered in dusk caked dark blood
It had been blood not oil that had been on the cords

Smears were left all over where Todd had touched himself
_

Todd finished dry heave'n down the elevator shaft
He turned to see what the other two where mezmerized by but none heretofore had time to see

This lower level was a run down dimly lit hospital
The shrieks were heard now hoarse

A loud clang shuffle and wacks where heard with yell'n
The voice immedately was silenced

The boys had taken shelter in an abandoned room
Wait'n for the commotion to settle down in order to proceed with the promise

Someone was trap'd & beaten in the concealed subbasement of the school
Whoever was run'n the system would no doubt win against the ignorant trio

For the entire period they waited between bells that could still be faintly heard

The room they hid in was hardly worth explore'n
All was open bare cast in some odd position of total abandonment
_

With their eyes and senses now accustomed they proceeded
The halls were built their the school, one large hall circled the outside classrooms and inside classrooms

The place betrayed obvious signs that this paths no longer used
Jordan headed their search track'n in the dust to know how long since use
The inside of the classroom had been the highest end of vacancy in the specturm
_

Soon Jordan was on a path that was taken daily
One heads of the path led to a stairwell
The other head they followed to a large open room

Setups like workstations arrayed the entire space

A low hang'n light over a stone table 
Rusted rungs were imbed'd as obvious retraint ports

Below the top were various shelves for various instruments
Jordans heart aun fainted terror when it became obvious all the tools in all the stations down all the rows had been used recently

There where daily tracks, recent tracks, no tracks as category for Jordans track'n which betrayed this rythmn of movement
This room was at times used for massive operation

Daily tracks the only path that led to a table far at the end with the only light on
_

Strapped to the table by leather cuffs was a nude redheaded girl
So bruised was her face that one could only assume she was freckle faced
As the rest of Jewels body
Freckled to the point that tho blood, aged & new, was only the second characteristic noticed

She had stichess from where she was opened
Many such patches were seen in similar fashion

Her eyes shut & teary burst out yellow orbs out of buldge'n eyes
Three boys not monsters, stood over her

'How to we get these loose
Jordan asked her as he was unable to free any strap

Confused near exhasperated
'How the fk do I get these off

Jewels looked back at him and opened a mutilated stump of a tongue 

'Finally sorry I can't speak even breath
'When you move like that
Infantile hands mades its way out of the hair to emerge a shrunked older head
_

The trio looked agast at a girl who had a shrunked head attached

'Yes this is a shock I understand
The little head said in a small voice

Jewels cast her face to the side ashamed, not only nude but as openly disfigured

The little head made a small exhasperated sound and moved into itself
A lump bulged and moved like a hamster under her skin from her shoulder to her throat

'I talked to you earlier by broadcast'n it from her vocal cords
'The bands are one leather belt    Above our head you can release it 

Jordan found the clasp to be an odd shaped clasp that took some ingenuity before it was released
Also with help of the metal bar and 6 arms

Jordans who shirt was mostly non bloody as being the last to descend handed Jewels his shirt
'We need to hurry the goons will be back soon
'If we are still subterranean when that happens we have no chance whatsoever

The shrunked form like to talk with its hands using the motion of its arms to excentuate what its voice was limited in express'n
 
Jordans shirt was large enough to cover all of Jewels sensitive parts
Promptly they made exodus from that devilish laboratory room
The walls of the place vibrate'n with unspoken legions of torment
_

The cord was now clean to allow them all quick access back up to the basement
Not till they reached the closet door did they recognize their perdicament

Todd was smeared over in blood, Jordan was shirtless
All were caked in dust
Jewels too much to mention

The school had ceaseless Monitored that roamed the halls to keep certain students on certain floors
In advent of see'n them the Monitors would be on them before they could breach the grounds

'We will have to wait for Last Bell
Jordan said assured in an authorative tone

'No no no that will be our undo'n
'Literally we will be crushed for this in mere minutes from when we are discovered gone
'This whole area was structured for that purpose alone

Dusty shirtless pantless bloody
They broke into the hall as cast from a horror scene into a monotony of regular moods that made the view more contrast to one who spot'd

Todd had the plan in his mind for long time of the quickest route of exit
They made it to the end of the hall in the basement before a teacher opened the door and yelled
!!! MONITOR

The call for all students to plaster at the windows
The four spectacted as they turned the corner to rush up the stair well

From their exit down the hall was the front exit
Two large Monitors stood as sentinels lock'n down protocol

!!! MONITORS
They in unison boomed unrelent'n to keep vigil at the exit

Todd was already lead'n them to the other stairwells across the level 
The shouts already at their backs

There was no time to explain only for Todd to choose and the rest to follow
_

Every window was filled & door blocked by curious children stir'd by the shouts
The teachers were in that way bar'd to even look to the halls

This the factor that allowed them to get to the second floor unhindered
They passed the restroom of the morn to the end of the hall

'Just do what I do and go where I go
He took out a key from his pocket & unlocked the window

They climbed onto a narrow ledge outside
The sun shone hotly on them already burn'n with exhaustion

The world around them too busy with their day to notice four odd bodies in Downtown
Their exit was seen by classmates but it would be time before this was transmitted to the Monitors
_

The ledge continued to an adjacent roof which they crossed to a high brached tree
The large branch invaded onto the build'n to a rooted attachment

By that means they climbed to the lower level at the back of the school
Alley to all edificies where only the garbabge collectors or dark dealers frequented 

Jewels only had a large shirt & Ben's sweaty socks
The large city bustlers went their way without heed as the four moved in a pack follow'n Jordan

They arrived at the edge of the district that broke into an industrial sector for the port
Jordan turned them into an alley & thru a open'n in the chain-linked-fence that Jordan loosed then replaced as they entered

Thru a locked window they quickly entered
_

The edifice was as dusty as the basement
They cautiously followed Jordans movements hop'n from board to board their trace without tracks up the stairs to a room
Jordan Locked the room with a chain & pushed away a cabinet to reveal a door also locked

There was a outside window that even exposed only did so to the open ocean
Dust free & ocean breeze Jordan led them thru the window to a ledge that was covered but of net'd metal

'I got a tank that collect rain water
'Open it & close it with this knob
He motioned them to turn around

He took a brisk wash
The water fell with distance splashed far below this area once a fire exit, but the stairs were chained up

'You love padlocks huh
Ben said at Jordan as he dried
'So what is this you clubhouse for these exact situations?

Jordan looked down as his face blushed
'This is one of the places I go to live

They showered with Todd last as he was so bloody
_

Refreshed & completely exhausted lay'n on layers of worked-cardboard to sleep on
Ocean gusts assuaged them all to deep sleep until Saturday

Jordan fed them dried fruit & granola that finished with a Mtn-Dew
'I got locations like this all over the city
'Each of them has a stash of all I need
'But I was stuck across towns and ate bad food I stashed there from a while back

'A hot summer
Ben said still bitter from now become permanent clown at the school

'Your parents should be freak'n out

!fk
Ben then realized his perdicament with this father
He was look'n forward to a self-righteous beat'n which are by far worse than the normal ones his father dishes
_

'Take everything I never go to the same place in the same week
Ben needed to get to the payphone back at the lower district
Jordan trailed them cover'n their tracks as they returned to the streets

The day was still early but warm'n to a hot day which would help their overworked bodies and stiff sleep

'I am the last of the litter with the room at the very end
'My parents wouldn't know if I was gone for a week

Jordan had a rummage of a trove at that place
Jewels was decked out head to toe with garments that mostly fit

The shrunken head kept silent know'n how much its presence pained Jewels
The press'n pace of life had left this baggage to be sorted out when time allowed

After 4 rings Ben tried the asshole oldman next over
'Heeh Hello
The old voice responded

'Mr. Grinvix this is Ben from next door
Ben said into the phone wait'n for sometime

'I just wanted to call to ask about my dad
'He isn't answer'n the phone

Ben waited awkwardly as there was only the sound of heavy breath'n

'Your dad is dead boy
'You best get to the authorities an have em tell ya
The voice was sympathetic but immediately hung up after the message was given

Ben stood silent phone to his ear
Flabbergasted from a truth revealed lie
He always knew his dad would be there
& Now he is not there
His whole being worked to come to grips as understand'n toppled down
_

!!! PLUUPP PLUPP !!!
A police car had silently snuck up behind the crew
Its lights now bright at their backs

'Alright you ju 
The cop cut short as the pack immediately bolted

He turned and fumbled into the door he had preemptively shut
Today was not the mood to be disrespected by children

'XO I got a 281 on that 48f
'Update the 48f is now a 49f

He reversed sirens blare'n not needed to give look a heed
In that action he was then fused with a pole as a overworked trucker plowed him to his death
_

Todd looked back in relief at the horrible accident
That cop was unquestionably the result of Ben contact'n his neighbor

What was this all about?
Did it have to do with Ben or what this a result of yesterday?

======================================================================

Todd led the exhausted group up the hills towards his home 
Ben had no said a word but his contenance exposed the truth

If this was about Ben it would be known 
Or if this is about yesterday his own life would likewise be shattered

Vital group comunicates can not be contained into words
A synchronized group says less and do more

Complain'n about the strain only weighs others down
& In the midst of a journey the strain is the general feel'n

The deep sleep of last night swept away traceless 
Only the entreched feel'n of a labor with no timely solution
Only the acceptance of pain as a state of being

The five miles drew two hours time
Heat'n day to full on sun under cloudless sky

Seagulls squaked at them as if enjoy'n their uncomfortable situation in the jealous envy typical of gulls
The world continued careless in their cars disconnected from their temporary coordinates
Distracted by the thought of the distination or deportaion

The four souls suffer'n & unable to begin to voice the matters at hand
Their own souls a full capacity try'n to come to grips with the present

The girl a freak whose utter truths laid bare under long presence
Before a set of strangers who on happenstance saved her & the miss

'My name is Miss
Jules broke the silence allow'n Miss to speak
_

The communication took time to digest
After the miles & silence of misery

Miss paitently continued
'I have been attached by operation  
'To this girl Jewels who was offered
'As sacrifice by her guardians to Dagon

The fantasic words to the drum & hum of day-to-day bustle that is life
Their worlds set in revolutions 60M times a second

Yet all seem so normal
As if the world around testifies
Whatever is go'n on is just day-to-day bullshit
--Let us keep it move'n

'Dagon is a cosmic god
'Earth is bribed to him
'As an occult offer'n
'In exchange for the bounty
'To which the god bestows
'After the feast of a meal

'All this he will swallow
'To drain dry as Mars

'Great powers lie as the foundations of this cult
'The promise is of omni powers uncalculable 

'Some envision an infinite life
'Indesuptably to be as god themself

'I am one of those in faith of Dagon
'All worth in exchange for a god's blessing

'Jewels was the daughter of a wealthy family
'To pay the price of a family to enter
'The prime of their seed must be exchanged

'I am 400 years old
'The symbyotic body of this girl now sustains me

'As payment into the order the past must live as the youth
'But don't you get this confused I offer much

'I heal her and repair her myself surgeon centries in experience
'I guarntee her life till old age as a promise

The arms of this creature now see as stilts puppeted
The core of it a brain shrunk to that of a squirell
The mass moved in a manmade skull the size of a golfball free to move in diffferent parts of Jewels body as stations
The right shoulder is Miss perch for when she talks caz she talks with the arms puppeted by latent muscles

'We worship the bowels of Dagon
'In her is inserted divine microbials
'This the digestion of the gods

'These sentient beings enhanced pure to worship the well being of the host as life itself
'From that sense I myself was of the first generation to live longer on hosts
'All work for the betterment of the whole which is Jewels
'I would proclaim she owes us much but she is a foolish girl with tears

'Yes she is foolish myself always busy patch'n up what she self inflicts

'Tho I am not sympathtic to her need to be kept un updated to a modular fashion
'The inner courts ordered her to be pieced into a more streamlined being
'The operation was for Saturday 
'All the surgeons were away for the a worldwide conference

All the boys the had a naw'n thought
'I am sympathetic to her, Jewels, who is held by us as a priestess
'Name annointed Jewels by the Seer who fated her to rise above the most high

'The freckles that she holds on her body are themself constellations
'To the coordinates for the universe that has worked out the best in every situation

'The Seer will seek her out because she is the map that leads us to that universe after the boon of Dagon
'The freckles change as echoes to the quantum world
'Understand this - her future has such consequence fate has map'd upon her the everchange'n direction of where to go

'Only by Dagon is this possible and with the bounty inevitable 

'Miss has been entrusted with this duty myself her humble overseer tho slave you may think she be
_

Miss stayed herself a while for Jewels to regain strength and the jobs was no easy task for miss to talk while walk'n

'The Esoteric Order of Dagon dates to our earliest history and is defcato the oldest creed of all
'Trends have taken its symbolism to idolitary all without substance

'The image of the lord Dagon is alone necessary to weild unobstructed power as the molecules themself bow to His domain

'I myself am a prophetess ordained by the Seer of whom is secretly entitled to follow as I may
'The thunder of your friend woke us to crys loud enough to reach the depths
'Providence appeared you before us to show us the path out of the system 

'Knights & heroes pale to the deeds which you have yesterday all fulfilled
'

The sun only an hour before noon
Silence followed the statement of Miss given with the surety

Find'n it a surprise to find that there was movement in his house
To defy the prophecy of Miss entirely


Not till after Todd entered the gate did he hear disturb'n sounds
The franctic followups between smashed revealed more than mere accident

Todd bore in head first into an immediate scene of mental chaos

Cats were everywhere in feline frenzy
A large one immediately charged for an attacked
Todd had two smart on it with a kick
Of the 10 cats that moved towards them in the attack
None of them cared much to risk in same fate of their leader

It a goolike mash upon the walls
Which in any other circumstance'd make them drool saliva, truly an event for the age

Several were on his mother frantic on the couch
With a justice that can only be filled with rigtheousness Todd clear out the house

His parents now foam'n at the mouth claw'n at the puss foam'n at each scratch
They were past dead & tears when the last of the cats caught in his grasps

Bathed in warm guts as he would use his might to break them legs to legs above his head their belly burst
This act would have all other cats in a lunacy to avoid the same fate

Cats always take too long to do anything aun to their demise
10s of bodies already litered the home as if a massive dog was unleashed with reason not mercy

Yet the tail end of near 100 cats led in mass in the same direction
_

Over short distance the cat is fast but over the distance mankind reigns supreme
Aun to naps the cats will be put off guard by the scent of the approach'n pack

The four over fence, thru yards, along country road, over cemeteries
Until finally rocky bays of ocean water rock to rock at an elevated mass of rock
The Cats with agility climbed up but still Todd much faster

The cats from boulder to boulder jummped defy'n the utter death of a mistake
Only one entry to a thicket walled bay Todd climbed up bleed'n from barnacled summits

A twist'n narrow tunnel opened up into a vast expanse 
Antiquated farm equipment animals of a startle'n variety all went around fire stained pits
One solitary hut built large as a warehouse loomed in the center

Tatched to sustain hurricane winds the edifice a concrete foundation
Bedrock to a large layer of sand  

A large bonfire pit in the center of the circular lot the center open two times larger
The whole was engeineer with a genius
If strong winds blow to hard the structure can reel up its barrier to be easily extended later

As the cat with the first warn'n returned with message
It was tailed by Todd himself as if that message only to introduce them
For that old woman to suffer a much more terrible fate

The cats would not near the area, and that is how the other three found their friend
Off to himself and they themselves overly content with rest'n 

Jewels stomached her way around the witch's hut
Parts of the witch were so scattered such that she hoped the reason to be of the cats
Take'n last pick at a pick'n

Leatherbound Tomes laid up balcony structures that held a pit in center with a iorn inlay pole to hook up a cauldroun
Jewels spent her time in the study of these and the deduction of the items still remain'n in each pit
_

There was no where to go but where they were
The supply of the witch would last them years

A water from a resivoir the size of a pond kept clean a source
Firewood came pentiful with the ocean drifts

Three weeks went by with even less words between them
All had lost much & only Jewels came out on top

As if ordained with the method of ones soul
Jewels absorbed herself into learn'n the ways of the witch

Jordan spent his time explore'n & admire'n the excellent situation of the island
This base would prove his most beloved 
Built from foundation to be off the grid but preserve'n arguably better utilities

A sandy cliff of ones own to drop off to ocean waters that moved in predicatble ways
One leap would exfoliate ones skin in a deep cleanse
_

Ben & Todd in similar circumstance
Understood each other as entirely divergent as their reactions conflicted

There was a global power that aimed to get them at whatever cost
To send cat assassins crafted by wiccan conjury of which Jewels with the aid of Miss abstracted

Jewels created her tome larger than four textboots in rectangle
In one large wooden shield The iron that bound sturdy wear resistant leather pages

The leather made from the thin flesh of dead cats
Of which due to Todd was in lifetime abundance
That cats revere'n Todd like an awesome diety
Tho all the others they favored gratuitously in a way of one redeemed to a good master
_

Day after day the testimony that all is only just another day
This the song of every bay its exiestence at times only seasons

Todd & Ben both well healed in time
With that careful slow heal'n in a healthy way 
In that way form a resilient seal to use it as battery from which to draw energy on daily basis

Ben have'n only the unix kernel & internel manpages from a solar powered onsite station
Todd in his day long meditations on core new meanings now exposed
Jordan lived in utter peace as if time finally paid back from ever turbid ages

Jewels armed as was Arthur of The Knights of the Round Table
Her shield a tome like a sceptere the mass of it a shrine to her newfound way
Miss ever diligent to guide and grow her talents into abilities

Driscol had been closed already permenantly
All the students had transferred to different schools

They learned these facts back in town at a store
A month from live'n there at the bayside hovel

Their hometown called them back they made the lengthy trip of whole half of day
The store to them as a feast money only too plentiful with felines as robbers

They stuffed the supplies into packs twinkies, bread, peanut-butter, cheeses
Downtown Library was Jordan's prime base of office
_

All baytowns pull in lost loiters world wide
Each soul on drift with the tide drawn from far away spheres

The library sat on the hill with all the homeless hobos just below
The edifice kept an overgrown lot to the back it a thick wild left as testament untamed

They had to crawl with their packs in front as they went thru a maze of crawl only thick trail too small it would cut them
Relentlessness tried if found true broke them into a open overgrown path

Sidwalk lights lit the completely enclosed tunnels 
The path led to a shed with power & water as a long forgotten shed for utilities

'My grandpa used to work here after a school research project on our ancestors I was led here

'It was rain'n like a muthfkr & cold as hell
'The security guard saw me wander'n he called me inside

'You can only stay four more hours till the end of my shift
He split his lunch & Jordan dried up on coffee his wife had made

That first time burst of energy propelled him onwar to discover an animal tunnel to the path which he eventually hacked away clear
_

The four rested on bedding stuffed with old twigs and leaves
Power filled their time Ben went back and returned with the computer
This place a much more stable enviornment for electronics

Ben became obsessed with the setup as if one beg'n for life to bestow new mean'n
By his unix network'n skills created a tcp/ip connection and secured them deals
 
When they needed odd necessities Ben would post them and find various people would would do them
Ben had collected a repitour of many names of which he manuevered to get whatever he needed

He once used that means to collude with his janitors to hack into his teachers computer

In this particular deal that consisted of transistors, pop-tars, Mtn-Dew, & tampons the guy offered to throw in an 1/8 of shrooms & marijuana
Ben who mistook them as being edible mushrooms, this thinking obvious from coming from the store, the well-tip'd driver put in gratefuly the paper bag 

He had to wait for an hour in the bush
That was Jordans oathsworn protocols
Which Ben resistless obeyed so great was his appreciation

Ben had be grab'n data from the archives at the library and store'n them onto detachable drives
His mainframe constantly whirred with its different activities
It greet him as he opened the shed door with the arms of supplies

'Who ordered the weed
Jordan immediately popped up followed by immediate self-awarness then shrunk down ashamed

'Jewels will like these
Miss said overlook'n Jewels rummage'n thru the bag

The boys kept down their communication naturally towards the two
Miss left no way to communicate with Jewels independently

That was how when Todd lurched out his hand force'n the ball that was Miss in one location
The other two without preemption held down Jewels firmly

Jordan reached to grab the chain
They had to make no room for question

Todd struggled not to strangle Miss while fight'n down Jewels
Who none of them could break to submission
'We    we need to 

! CRUNCH !
Jewels head butt Tood's jaw closed

'ST STOP
Ben got at her but she let her elbows fly accoustomed to more monsterous hold

Jules broke free and ran into the restroom
Ben was pray'n his nose wasn't broken like that one kid from math
_

It was time before Todd got the idea to pass thru a notebook

'Trust me when I say Miss is dear to me
'Her over anyone else is my true friend

Blood is thick with one's identity
The composition is stired by one's emotion

Blood magic draws stregth from those forces
They drank the brew of shroom blood masked with mint leaves

'May the blood split
'For concern of other
'Bind us Five together

Four
One at each corner
Arms the connection between

The vapor off the brew to inhale them aroma of the hot brew digested
The pot laid in the circle chalked with their diagram as borders
 
Their movements like all surf'n on the same wave
All in tune at different positions to the swell

They took their always packed packs & left Downtown
Instead of the left turn towards the Dunes
Jewels lead them to her old school

The Duties were two old dike identical twins
The two were all bruisers but all still questioned
The answer was put when they got hold of an abductor 
The man was not a small man but he didn't leave alive

In that fame they reigned never get'n checked but never step'n out of line
But old age has its time & biological beings like to sleep at the same hour

15min to get the bikes out

They dove in the lot sneak'n under the booth were on que slept the two
Every action was worrisome for them Jewels stitched face & unseeming passager
City authorities already on the alert to get them
Have'n singlehandedly cause their school to be shut down forever 

Stressed persperation bloomed from their palms all familiar with the Duties
To their surprise Jewels confindence pulled thru without complaint

The lot of bikes were open for the take'n
Unchained by the confidence of the Duties who knew the owner of each

Several bikes looked like gang
All other bikes respected the pack with space

Jules went immediately and lifted the bike on her off shoulder holding the pedal with her hand
Her bike was the leaders obvious as it was tricked to shit

Todd took the practical road-bike
Ben & Jordan both preferred mountain-bikes 

Follow'n Jewels silent directions they kept the bikes from make'n noise
As they unobstructed were back out on the streets within 5 minutes

After make'n the turn on the corner they shouted & hooted
High speed on their new bikes fit against a lot to choose from


By the time they came off their high they bayside front bonfire nightsky at the Dunes
Todd kept all their dealings in a record which he without break kept in his trip

They all stared at his replication of the diagram now drawn in a virgin part of the dunes at South Moon
Jewels never kept from work and produced the brew she had made memorized by Miss

All attention on the moment
Each have'n lost & gained something worth longlasting contemplation 

The diagram was singular in fashion & make but filled them with longlost familiarity
'I believe us all contacted my friends hy other being who reached out to us

'Dagon, we are taught is the god of universe
'His echo from AEons       His might truth
'Many call him forth as a forgien train with irreplacable goods
'Let'n all be plowed thru at his arrival
'The distance that seperates the cosmos is unfathomable
'Quantum properties testify that all things come to pass that are passable

'The distance tween unbreachable 
'Aun for the Holy Dagon

'Each life has the power infinitely strong to breah the barrier of distace
'To contact the other thru the human spirit consortium
'All hearts to power the other in a robust network

'This power when grouped by massive movements
'Can open the portal to allow Dagon God thru

'Thru ancient traditions passed down by the ages
'We reknewn tonight the Artes of Occult Cosmos Projection

'This diagram given to us is the private yet public key
'We alone are familiar with it and if we are lured by dangerous hands
'It will be this diagram that confirms one member of our Order of Ourselves

'Our structure will be our position we assumed earlier
'We will bind our hands & sleep 
'By purchase of comfort we will attain a way to project to other realities
'Able to learn on a scale of infinity which all tend to confirm a singular

Position laid natural as if only need a nudge to fall full swing
All woke each in a different quantum reality in control of Lucid Dreams

000000 TODD   00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
All the world was inside a dome of earth
As if a massive volcano covered all but did not consume it

The plants he marvelled at
Each plant was different glow'n with florescent juices

It was primal joy to slash & slash make'n tunnel to move forwar

'My dog     I need to find my dog
'I pass  my voice to you

The movement was hurried but the pace of endurance without hope of near end

Plants pletify that burst as a warm slushy tastful sticky goo
Each bite was joyous but none allowed him a sense of fulfillment

'Dogs   Dogs logically may gravitate towards the high corners
'Echoes will seem to originate from there and call to the dog naturally

The epiphany was a burst of joy to the boy 
Which knocked with a force Todd bolt'n up still cuffed

000000 BEN    00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Darkness 
Darkness but a candle

No he was turn'n to dark walls of different colors
His hands worked fast on one of the many keyboards that laid on the massive workbench

Lurch'n into a roll to clickity clack clak code review'n it on the wall in front
The characters would pour down, fill him with satisfaction never so deep, and then he would immediately push on to the next

White line all prepared with an odd manner
'Give me guidance I am done here

With a swift habitual movement his hands made sign
Cut out a symbol in the white

SNIFF

Ben's eye jerked open darkened by Todds shadow sit'n up
The fire was longsince burnt out and he was cold

000000 JORDAN 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Work every second a drag
New customer same complaint

New room same mop
In & out in a dreary life

Forced by the system this way with no escape
On pentance for being too poor to afford house'n

000000 JEWELS 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
She was radiant with sunrays thats sparkled off her hair off her eyes that bounced from her wet tongue to the frame
The bike hop'd onto the rail and skid down trai'n sparks

I shouted partly aroused there a deep well of sexual desire to be cast with Jewels in forbidden love
_

All awoke with Todd
But all felt in control

Time they understood in that realm was null
As if without gravity warps to no lines of perception

'This symbol here 
Ben redrew larger the polygon 

'This means something to me now I can feel it      I want     I want to tatoo it on my knuckles

In time & practice Jewels steadied by her lack of empathy for other's pain
Used the root of an herb with the ink of an octopus that Jordan hooked up

It made a fine meal & Jordan offered the clean sac to Jordan
This prompted the impulse of Ben to continue with the idea
Jewels practiced steady hand & lack of empathy for pain bore upon her a new skill

With a natural sunbleached spine she worked upon his hands a mixture augmented by Miss who together made a masterpiece
Ben's fists made mirror images of the symbol in black which turned to a light brown-red under the sun

The work took many hours & became a session of bond'n for the three
_

They set Friday night after a long adventure as the time to perform the rite of sleep drug'd by fumes at the Dunes

For four days they would migrate to one of Jordans many spots
City life was necessary to trade for goods
Jewels made aroma-therapy candles that she parted off for high prices

Water wasn't plentiful at the Dunes nor was the enviornment kind to plants
Miss had informed them of Jewels idea to grown her own plants
Massive acres of farmland would be ideal places to plant where they would be watered

Jewels had cared from seed month old plants
Each had one now nested on their bikes basket

The agitation would present long lasting danger which would make the core stronger
Roots would grip with a steadfastness that would empower them on plentiful plains 
_

Across town & down endless roads
Each truck pass'n honk'n at them
In say'n they were watcehd strangers

Hours passed into moonlight
Jewels finally stop'd the pack

'Yes there is deep water in the air
Miss affirmed with a sense of pride

Bikes were stashed inside the overgrown streetside drainage
Jordan always covered them with a dark tarp he locked
'Bikes always will betray you with a sparkle if you let them
'Lets see someone manage to lift four awkwardly placed bikes locked in tarp
Jordan was always up to his practical ingenuities that bore him confidence

Jewels carried her pepper plant, it a variation her own spliced make
Peppers that kept off parasites, peppers that helped keep meat, leaves that produced thick smoke

10 Acres in they walked along the fence 
Bugs bit at their salty wet legs in a frenzy

The small hill was used to hold a resivor of water
From the layout it must do its part well 
Leakage made it difficult for them with mud

'No one has been here for years
Jordan pointed at the rust on the pointless gate they easily hurdled

That wasn't the only sign or long abadonment
A old camp chair was next to a rusted thru tin bin full of decades old crushed beer cans

Strewn about were odds that spoke of a person who used this place to be alone
It must have been misery to choose this mosquito infested parcel to lounge

'This is definitely manmade
Ben said assured by certain molds of the hill that had longsince become organic

They twisted & curved make'n a path that Jordan knew was pointless to cover
Plants were too thick & greedy for space
_

Foliage was 10 feet high but at the summit all broke into a grassy top

It was open & looked impossibly larger than from below

The water was a small pond flush with the ground
To the point one would think it a hole
Till they saw their reflection mirroed back at them

The memorial plaque at the Downtown memorial described how difficult of a process it took to create a perfect mirror from water
Here under full harvest moon was a more perfect reflection

No buzz of bug nor intrusive plant on this high plane of mount
The grass untamed by man a lush kentucky green cool & soft to lay on
Blades of it didn't cut the skin more it clung to it like gauze 
The face of it a balm upon their tired & bit & sunbaked flesh

After two minutes with plants aside the manmade waterhole
All unknowingly let themselves be drifted off to quantum realms

They looked across to the other
All sat legs crossed comfortably

A large wick candle blazed crackily
Smoke thickly cloudy a mint heavy aroma

There was a omnious sound that first wasn't heard
It crept upon their awaken'n concious 

'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh
All were sync'd of mouth
There was no Miss on Jewels

Jewels eyes burst widely open
'They have arrived to our call

'Welcome all four
'9 Long months we
'Chanted out for thee

'Many have come & gone
'But of you we seeked

'I am the Grand Prophet Jewels

Jewels spoke in a firm beauty that all had heard in their minds

'My kin have on santified planes
'Exchanged their voice for mine

'My voice is true & worth their sacrifice
'Monks life was not their choice but given
'Powers off their sacrifice bless infinite realms
'As echo I beseech thee to meet in thy realms
'To join as able & recieve the call
_

One woke slowly
Entranced by their chant

Eyes only opened
After dryness of tongue
Welled up deep tears of agony

Each across the other
Crossed on sore legs

All drug themselves heavily
To the banks off that purity

Not for hours did they speak
& Of that being their experience of Her

All looked at Jewels with wonder
Miss still asleep out like never before
The instant Jewels woke have'n had passed out of exhaustion

Jewels bleed have'n else wise mayhap died from dried caked blood 

The summons they learned 
the next day recovered enough to return 
Three days & nights they sat

A powerful Jewels had dealt them great harm 
To wretch them this way so great was their suffer'n

Miss too full of weep'n to form thought
Old woken to a entirely new form of hell

Saggy & old now as a tumorous rasin
Each full of pity for wrongs against her

That night she was buried under
Full Harvest Moon 
Tide as never seen before

Burn'd back as star
In the comsic burial of the flame

Drift wood piled high
Gulf wind as great engine

Themselves they found
Were ones greatest enemy

The next months were spent at the Library
Each time out only to hoard and return

Jewels gave her all into sign language
Which effort always forgien to her

Boys even out of patience to the strech of the task
Aun Jewels created a light system as code
When communicate'n on their long trips to the pond

She would often give the wrong words
Which the boys always took as final word before an pursuit

Once they thought she was pregnant
A topic only by jealousy partook
Till each admitted no to the other

Them have'n great fights on all levels
To return and discover Jewels actually meant 'peaches
_

The plants were grow'n strong under the care of Jewels
Now there massed a great greenery

The pond soil rich & warm to company

All knew there was something coming
They would get a message of a journey soon

Now they would prepare 
_

They woke again one morn
At the pond chant'n
The same tune of that one time
But the words only now audible

'Dagon the dragon
'Is coming thru you

It was a message their corporal bodies
Said & heard thousands of times

Their physical & mental being testified its truth
_

'This reality on the Quantum scale
'With the Order's strength longsince global
Ben charged at the others in an understandings tone
He broght them before bonefire & fast from want of food

'Our reality will be destroyed
'Who but us will be capable to forsee it

'What could we do    Its impractical to believe three boys, a girl & bikes count for jack shit
Jordan now encircle'n the crowd lead'n them to his understand'n

'True but what Ben says may be true
'Aun to hope
Todd now stood stright unmoved

'She had been chant'n nine months for our presence
'Why go thru all that to give out hopeless warning

'She has a knowledge past our understand'n 
'Moreso we all knew that she believed in us

Jordan looked up with a face that was normaly used before a long rant of self-reinforcement
'The base is always the nest of the hive
'One doesn't keep the queen away from nest

'We know the old school & we can break in I bet
Jordan looked back at their astonishment
'If we are going to do the impossible it will atleast
'Be something that I been plan'n to do since we left
All somehow creepily knew that Jordan 
Left a stuffed animal he loved to fk in the locker

Jordan only had little sense of the shame when it was brought up
Which he didn't like to bring up often though he always tried to rant-redirect to it
_

The animal was a Giant Panda named Cammie
When asked what something that private was doing in a locker Jordan only said
'I wanted to take it into the Art Room

The lack of over-explanation connected them to conclude
That room held a romantic part of his heart

They didnt know how they would live
The replica tattooed on the belly of Jordan's tummy was annoy'n enough
What a terror it would be like to live with the real thing 
_

Ben kept his network offline
His nodes only connected to local networks to siphon off data
 
From early on he discovered all traffic 
Goes redirected thru the Univeristy Hospital Hub

They have backdoor control over all the machines in this region
Most of their task is junk monitor output that no one can parse

Ben's dad knew a guy who gifted Ben his main puter
All the parts are handcrafted works by a native tribe

The purpose is to be a listener 
Only ever sniffer of traffic
Never prints left or trace

Only ever a bridge to scan data & replicate it to archive
 
'Todd you never asked me why I was chased that day
Ben said to the group all chewed roasted pepperoni front a bonfire

'I had gotten access to all terminals
'My dad flip-ta-bich & slap'd be good for that plant

'He actually came out to get me call'n me on my lie
'I didn't leave the computer lab where I planted till after 8pm
'Id catch the last bus home & say I had to piss
'Cept for my dad had come out all concerned
'Expect'n me to have him all up as Knight in shine'n shit
'So after the third hour he was pretty welled up

'But yeah anyway I ran terminals from 3am-5am to calculate the key that the region uses
'I got impatient and was check'n on the output I had print out in the janitors closest
'Those goons caught me right before that corner
'If that code is cracked, which I believe I did
'Go'n to that school is our most important task
'With that key all traffic would be plain-text to me

'Jordan maybe we sell ourselves too short
'Who else in the fk'n city could get access like that

Jordan gave him a coy cock back
'Well if its so simple why hasn't anyone else done it 

Ben only said
'I never said it was simple         Man what a hacker I was
'Moon till fkn noon

Ben would have to power to inspect all computer traffic in the entire region
All sources first routed here then inspected and forwarded

Insomnia grew with him since child
Night was the time dad pop'd the bottlecap

& If you weren't actively move'n 
Pops could always manage to find you

Popped on your head the longer it took him
Almost as bad as after he realized he ran out

Think'n about your new school shoes
About how he could of at McDonalds that day
If he no longer bore the expense of two

Ben easily avoided that clumsy lunatic 
Who was his dads favorite state of being

Ben had time to read
He built lights or even read in the open
Depend'n on the current position of his dad

'If you didn't mark it
'There was no point have'n to remember it
'If there was no point of have'n to remember it
'Then why the fk would you read it boy

Ben looked up to his dad despite his weaknesses as a father
Cracked to the core of his being struggle'n with that
& Also stuck being a single dad to provide all in a hard world

His dad would steal textbooks for him from the city library
Ben would wait in the car on always rainy days
'Got to give you a reason to stay hood'd up son
'Two coats is the perfect combination to steal large

Gleam'n as a proud man does when pass'n down a lesson for the ages
Present'n two large textbooks of various sort

Dad look'n at the confused expression of his son as ingratitude
'Listen shithead when you get the balls that drop and the skills like mine
'Only then do you deserve was kind of fruit of the tree you be able to eat

Yeah
Ben's dad was a true muthrfkr

The type to fk around with you
Then leave you stuck with a babe for 2 yr

But with the gathered courage to come back to raise him singlehanded
A fact that Ben would always use as pillar to keep the image of his father holy

Most the while being kicked around in day-to-day bullshit

Ben did eventually take up the tricks of his dad to be able to favorite old unix books
Black screen command line terminal for those who want to stay close to the kernel

Able to get the same enviornment on most any computer
He filled his usb with this enviornment & all favored documentation

Keep'n to the muthrfkr routine that needed less & less alcohol after each year
Dad became utter ashamed & regretful he ever taught him to steal books
'Learn'n is fine but no man would trade that for real life skills
'----like that fkn cop'
'----like your bitch ma'
'----like ....'
_

Ben overall was grateful for his dad who lived his life in grand ways
'But that muthrfkr always thought he was always right
Lets see a mob of men take hold of the entire regions traffic

Ben said accidentally to the interrupted silence
Before meal was a time of fast
Food cool'n to cold in front
Busy in meditation or some stationary task

Ben would hack on a laptop
Jewels would knit to keep her hands dexterous for talk'n
Todd would write down the histories of their days
Jordan would keep the fire

Starvation bonds are exploited if it is seem-starvation
The body amoung smells of food will quick-trigger this state

Allow'n the host to be more receptive to the voice of an Outsider
Outsider give only partial power to make an idea known in their way

Hosts have complete power at all times
All lines severed because of an extreme action (emotions scares) & are permenant

Her that summoned them had one message and it was in a clarity that required no detail
All would be destroyed, first their reality, the thru worldwide suffering Dagon would portal onwards
A Quantum consumption of reality where all possibilities scarce but one Dagon

Thus upon each conquest Dagon's ghost remain absorb'n all possiblilities as batteries
Death in any possibility would transfer him back a universe always at a distance aun too great for that god

This domino reaction is the fundamental basis for godhood

'I plan on kill'n Dagon good
Talk'n breaks a sacred silence demand'n attention from all 

The words fell so alien as to numb their understand'n

'We will use Quantum portal against it
The group did not know who was talk'n, Ben or Other

'You will sacrifice your world
'My reality will kill it

'Before that happens you must have nullified his ghost
(ghost is the essence that soaks up possibilites from which transcendence [death -> other reality])
_

Ben as Jordan kept it real his entire life
Day to him was a finite time of which to complete a project

Quantum realities benefit all as one & one as all
Each action feeds into the other as inate experience often understood as instinct

If anyone of the group in all realities would figure out the impossible to destroy all deities 
That person would definitely be Ben

This heavy thought passed them two days fast as a call for all for aid
In pleas for energies & inspirations to be sent out for their purpose

All agreed with Ben
To destroy a god is a rare chance

To succeed would then elevate themselves as gods
Only gods can destroy gods

Todd was the prophet to them 
Since a child he devoted himself

Meditation Supplication & Fasts
These are the tools of his trade

In most dire circumstances 
Todds flashes of inspiration every time has saved them

Self sacrifice as a blood offer'n in an advent to breach barriers with power
He was called to fulfill the most nobel act of his belief

He called on Justice for the crimes of consume'n all for one idea alone
Anarchy is the language of mother nature who birth all universe

This rite for not only themselves
But to sacrifice their entire realm

None had families they were obliged to save
This fact odd past coincidences

The actions of the Order had seal their own fate
Bonds between them all naturally strong
_

Today was a Dagon holiday all would take part in symbolistic sacrifice
They would hoist a paper mache in likeness of a specially chosen friend
The insides would be fake boweles and wrapped candy

People would be insane crazy here at the capitol
Others come'n from all around to impress how they celebrate

Of all days of the year even the four were bum'd that holiday would be the best time to get business done
All ages did the same general ritual but in divergent ways

Adults raffled contestants to leave one chosen to be hoisted naked on a cross
All able to grab or poke as pleased in their momentary pass'n

The part is coveted as one of the most sexually satisfy'n experience possible


The old would have one chosen to lay down all who passed put in their clothes a little money
The young would find a kid they particularly disliked & tie him to a lamp post to throw their stored shit at

Children that night were the terrors and monsters of nightmares
If they wanted you, there always too many packed up
Able to be bored enough, & threatened enough to be in right position

They would jump you & you just better give up caz they always catch you
More that two have been found beaten to death for some injured vengence paid back to the 'special

Most people stayed on busy streets or in houses as the kids preferred open vacant places

It was merely near 1am of that day as the four travelled back to the school
University Hopsital had viligint surveillance but today of all would be the best chance
_

'We get the key then go to the lower floor as before
'There should be the network hub where all data rests

Ben told them repeate'n

'I will run these preset scripts I been develope'n since before we met
'If there is a disadvantage or a way to crack their portal & they've share it
'Then we will have it for an answer

Jewels went up to each of them, stared them in the eye, then rubbed pepper all over their body
When nostril monsters were sent for them this pepper would force them pain each track until they were useless in long distance

Out back in view of the large tree that laid upon the roof of the second level 
They got off their bikes, lift'n them into the dumpster
Jordan then went down there and ran a chain & locked them up

'The easiest way to carry a large chain & lock
'Is to have already left it there for later use

Tarp as cover accompained with other odd/ends gave them enough security
All evaluated the edifice thouroughly for answers to future puzzels
_

'Hey you there    What you kids do'n here this late
A light hit them 

Possibly it was the clatter made from the bikes put in the dumpster
This night went off start'n from completely unexpected

Jewels bolted into a multi-level parking lot that was unmanned this late in the night 
All others trailed at her heels

They ran like the universe depended on it
Ever up & up & up across open wide spaces

They could not juke or hide in such perdicament
Up & Up they went to be inevitably trapped

Even the Cop knew it have'n let his pace slip off after the first floor
Know'n all he had to do was be intime to be sure to catch them go'n higher
_

'Oh fk oh fk oh fk!
Ben let out exhasperated breath'n untempered ocean winds overlook'n the dark deep bay

His face worked upon in agony as about to fail in his most important task
Jewels grab'd his arm sure & he caught back his tears as he turned to her

<special>
Immediately Ben understood how that would save them

Each place'n themselves in positions that would best echo
Loom'n over the ramp that would lead the cop up

The light flashed first then after time followed the cops
'Alright you dumb fks no where to go now

His words were met with nothing which was eerie
Too proud to do a Call-in say'n he was chase'n kids and wanted to check-in
Not with Shanda or Morrbud work'n the waves

She would likely ask 
'Please repeat that
As she forwarded the message to a select channel

He was almost halfway up the ramp and still no sounds of pointless scuffles
Nervous people never do one thing among all the crazy shit they do: they never stand still

The cop let himself mutter a curse
'If either of those bitches get chosen as


!!! SPECIAL !!!
They all on que in unison broke into yells of count, they as well as the cop, would swear under oath as more than four

Without need of instincts even a cop knows not to stir the kids on DagonsEve
The downward slope was his one mercy of the night as he ran so hard he tore a ligament & vomited need'n an ambulence

The four saw him down the city street back to them on the payphone

The cop wouldn't send in a force and this sector wouldn't be bothered with anymore tonight
They slept securely in the Auditorium locked & inhale'n incense

Dagons Eve Day


The flames wicker entraces one with its whispers of cosmos
Flame created all & flame will consume all

Those of the Deep Order, fishy humanoids carried candles made all year from their own fat as wax and wick from skin
They would to large for any ocean gust to blow out

All in a line they placed them face'n the infinite oceans
Each behind as pillar chant'n out the calls of the messangers

A puppet lay against a white polished stone altar
The mass of it could kill a man emermoniously gowned and more than centeries old

Iron, Wood & Leather

The cords that tied each enourmous piece together now sprung tight with a twang
'Have you prepared our resorts for the Inspector Gibbis 
The voice of that off a record player horn

Each syllable said with an infinite range of shutters of the needle which the horn echoed true


'Master we have it prepared in a way that may impress your Order
A man in a weathly suit but other than that could hardly be called a man

His upper body the face of a salmon 
Eyes buldge'n out to await expected anticipation

'Sushi

There was a pause while the priest contemplated
Upon instant of understand'n head snatched off like a viper

'AEons old knows no sense of the emotion impress
'Fools all will suffer the same fate

The large mass instantly tumbled
Many in the crowd caught off guard

As arms like logs fell crack'n open any in its path
All around without delay lurched upon the death

Devour & Devour raw on the spot
More fishlike they became in wicked sharp quick pointed ways

Legs like frogs that could make great distance & also great speed
A mouth streamlined wicked it charge thru like death wind

The change happened instantly
Their mircobials morphed with new algorithmns to empower the host 

Dawn left the light on nothing
The bones to death gathered

The stew with such strength it brew in abundance
_

Once inside the school all was free range
There was not even electricity to the place so stingy was the hospital
All dark & already seemed caked in dust

Till the grain of it too fine
& Its incindeary nature understood

Jordan's locker was the first stop he demanded
Like a gooddamn romance novel they united

All affirm the power of that moment
'Be right back
Jordan said already waddle'n pants down
_

Ben was typically disgusted with Jordan
Survive'n made the kid just off from the rest

He only agreed to come this way because the Art room was near the computer lab
To the left thru the janitor doors under the stairs
The printer & rogue node off quite

Upon the printer was found nothing
The code would have printed out if it was successful

All his code & years yet he failed
That aun past the 100th experiment

The fumes got to him as he heaved in & let out his first cry he can remember
It came out in a squake'n odd way that Tood immediately looked at Jill
'Maybe Id prefer to guard over Jordan

Jewels ducked her head in a silent chuckle 
Yet fresh coy as if to follow that girlish giggle

!!! PPPPPPPPHHHHHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK !!!

!!! AHH !!!
!!! AHH HAHHHH HAAA !!!
!!! YEAH MUTHRFKAH !!!

Ben dove into the hall five papers held up to the light
Upon them the dust they gathered when they'd been knocked to the corner 
By a pissed off Janitor who flip'd a bit with the news he was fired

'Guard this with your life
Ben said if a cheer 
'Here to each is endowed the private key of this public crypto system

The node was off but Ben anticipated it with USB & several batteries at hand
He had it up-to-date by the time Jordan was done smell'n of what dead-ppl-dust smells like wet from semen

They kept movement which made the smell unbearable

Tatiana had been fitted to mold itself to Jordans pack
To a freakish likeness it looked like a Giant Panda was hug'n onto Jordan

University Hospital vacant yet for a few guards
Out enjoy'n the festivities right across the street

The four already up looked greatfully at the door
The incident must have been the last string to cut the cord
No one bothered to even close the door as the grounds so closely watched

With so little to see in downtown school
What is seen is worked over and over

One generation will have that genius
To crack more a crack in the system

'When we get hot I'll stop
'The systems wont be on a cool level
Ben told them anticipate'n the whir of cool'n & the heat it gives off
He would venture alone then morse-ping walkie-talkies

Each of them all four would have to manually replace the keys use'n a terminal game

Ben decended into the completely black abyss
Naught 4 floors & still further, the blood never an issue this far from the hospital
No fresh meat tonight dure'n celebration

Only Ben alone in a monster Jewels could only hint at
Too far down for the others to reach
Too long since he realized the walkied out of reach

Yet he kept go'n down decsend'n madly

This would be the most probable location
If there was a path to dig deeper a core away from the crust is always better

As these things do it was noticed in an instant
A continuous whur too constant to be wind or gusts

The port was easily opened & entered
Some things you have to do alone

This too dangerous for the company of others
Who ever dove this deep would be fked dead
As Jewels so proudly says to her past

If he lost his all-in 
They would have 3 still available

As long as he stayed in the pipe he would get to the server room
The walkway large enough to only duck

Node was in back in his pack caz his hammer was out
It was his dad's frame'n hammer a gift from a boss

A blow would crack any muthrfkrs skull
Never caught mess'n with it but bash'n it since youth

Ben never knew that his Dad always knew
It was the cause of an off beat'n that Ben couldn't attribute to anything
As the action had been months prior

His dad almost drunk picked it up to examine it to give him a reason to get re-pissed
That was when he noticed there was no careless gash upon the fine wood with the new-made blows the dad could see any misstep would have done so
The boy could hit a nail better than any man he knew
Maybe unsaid thoughts as theese are meant mainly for the thinker

Ben griped the two handed hammer cocked to prove something
His own movements were masked in the hot air

Ben skin was red have'n been slowly heated for a long time but it was too dark for him to know
Past mile he felt he walked There were several bends then a turn to a bright light

The room was under the bay look'n up sealed air tight
The coolness of the ocean is enhanced by the glass

This is a water-cool free setup that is impossible for fan-cooled
But the ocean changes that limitation allow'n a completely dry fan-cool

The array was massive government grade likely the world entire

He was go'n to reintroduce encryption with the results of a human scrabbled databank he'd been work'n on years
He would overwrite the public key on the all hosts & the mainframe private key
 
Now hooked into the network plaintext no security
Himself not even in the room but still in the vent

Security was only a bother they thought

Root on all machines instant!

He nmaped every endpoint, reconfigured the kernel, recalculated the new private network key & encrypted everything
Only he would be able to log in
Their only choice to to take it offline and by the size of it that would introduce a pelthora of issues
Or the only actual choice accept the new system & keep it running

He had root instantly to all the node map'd to an array terminal network command echo
All but a minor percent would be a native host for his kernel so he did it

He built the kernel on all inner node and almost all outer nodes
Each kernel mapped and keyed each other kernel 
All route & data information would be encrypted to any observer

Ben single-handedly took over a system almost without casualty
Apart for the people that died from his decision there was also
The next follow'n events that would seperate him the rest of the night

Several nodes like stars started to blink red
The alarm that was off he could have sworn he had used to hear walk'n along the bay

This would play out two ways
He would  fix it
Or get caught redhanded in the act in a massive room
_

In a frantic decision they decided to test the weight of them all
Each have'n used their legs to support most of the weight

Then one by one drop'n weight
But they didn't go down
They climbed up leave'n a note in sand at the door
 
Next phase of the plan they did themselves
They would infiltrate the levels & extract data off the machines using the USB & BIOS train'n

With that data they would use for the enemies against enemies enflamed by the truth
To rip apart a society in an openness that can no longer be concealed
_
There were 7 floors of patients that were all sedated & couldn't hear the noise they were all make'n
Body parts would be stuck hang'n always fresh that means there is something that regularly cleans this tunnel up

Finally on the first floor they opened up
It was an open floor like a factory of cubicles

They all had computer terminals

'Da fk
Jordan complained
'I say we skip this floor

<<He said trust him>>
Jewels signed impatiently also fretted herself

The USB did'nt boot
As Ben said in train'n F12 => boot sequence
If this didn't work they were shit out of luck for this floor

A red ASCII demon appeared
The system began because various ASCII banners of mythical creatures said they got good fed

It became apparrant that this was going to take time
The way the information flushed aroused Jewels & now she understood Ben a little deeper
_

Now they had been rested from the climb
This they found had been the simplest task

They went floor to floor always via the tunnel never use'n elevator or stairs
On Todds good judgement they were not all cuffed within 10 minutes of a detection incident

They had 45 minutes of time to go & see what they could get
Now after the bios boot was set they node would connect to the node on the first floor automatically to an encrypted transfer

Todd kept to the deepest corner offices
From what he understood all the dirtbags chose those

Sometimes he would need to look on the screen and deduce instructions
For the most part it was quick dependable set up that connected clean with no incident
_

By the 15th floor the tunnel stop'd 
The upper floors were securely partitioned

They slid down use'n gloves & their feet
_

'Where the fk were you guys
Ben looked in a cocked position ready to bust somebody like his dad

Jewels was unable to respond that dark

'Did'n you see the sand pile
Jordan filled in for Jewels

Ben felt stupidly now the sand already ammased as silt bags in his socks

His cast down expression was completely morphed when he learned they already accomplished the secondary task

'Holy fk its too dense to explain here
'Yall we reshaped the history of our entire world

The code was still run'n so they felt they would return later
They would stick together

Jewels was too put out
Todd & Ben continued alone


Like the wind of a dragon
A gust blew past the corridor up
Thousands of claws scratched by

Jewels pissed her self a little
Gasped out relief that it wasn't her death

Then the piss turned cold against her icy body
It was come'n for Todd & Ben

It would be on those two before she could climb a level
She laid down Jordan & sent a message thru her loss of virginity
_

Todd smelt the fire first
'Oh shit
He said down to Ben

Thru the vents they saw commotion of people put'n out a small fire
Likely flame'n from an overworked computer

'No worries
Ben said grip'n Todd's tense shoulder
Todd expression now seen by slits of light

'There are backup nodes I have for this exact purpose
They went two levels more & plug'd into the network

He set the node to flash its screens 
The light would be seen at a distance
But still it took them time to find


Above the box as dark figures Ben clutched the warm usb
One of the few large enough attached to the network

'ssssssseeeeeeeee sssseeeeeeeeeeeeee
The form of it flash'd against the glass panes in front of them

'tttttttttttttsssssssssuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
'sssssssssssssssseee ssseeeeeeeeeeee

In a mechanical & studdered movement the boys turned
Ben's knuckles white hold'n the hammer
Todd used the turn to unhook his blade

The glint of it agitated the monster
Brite Brite die now
It thought cruelty now more than pleasure
_

Horrid host from hell as a blur it dove at Ben
Who caught it surprised with so formidable a weapon

The hook tore off a gash of a few nodes of claws
After the hammer had caved in a shoulder blade
Of many that were in an array

The beast then smarted by the blow rose up
15 Male torsos formed a train commanded by the Master

The monster that sat on top was gluttonously overweight
Head 3 feet wide that seemed to form around its mouth

'sssssssseeeeehhh uuuuuuuuu wwwwwaaaaaannnnttttsss llllesssssssss
'lllllllaaaaaaaahhhhsssssssss

'eeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttt

The heads of each torso had its skin dried to leather with no mouth & flesh overgrown eyesockets
The eyes were sown in a fixed position at each shoulder to see at all sides

Ben knew that fat bastard being up top had felt his blow
Even the gruesome sight of the muscled arms mounted by fingers worn to claws

A dark fleshy tube ran down its back the iput socket the mouth the out from the torso to other mouth

Todds body began to glow
Aun it shined off the glass

The eyes of the thing winced blind

Ben go to it first
He darted to jump off a table and went for the first tubes input
Hammer head caved it in with the troughouness of expectation
  
Todd climbed up on it
Aun in thankful submission the arms would expose their left pit to a heart
The location easily noticed by the dark purple blood pump'n out merrily


The effort wasn't enough 
Sluggish but still capable the monster dove at Ben & past

The lunge so swift it was sight before feel'n
His arm & harm had been swept away forever

The would bubbled and pussed with a sticky saliva that carterized the wound

Ben made a final handsign with the one left over

!!!JEWELS CATCH!!!

Ben bounded towards the corridor with the dedication of an all-in cast
His life & cards had run out no longer capable of being a hacker

The USB was tight in his only clenched fist 
Delerious in shock but directed firmly as Other
_

Todd still glowed as if a flip switched on a transformation
With great stregnth he brought the beast down to submission

With its dead drag'n back firmly grip
Todd thrust the monster to under its claws down

'ssssssssssssshhhhh nnnnnnnooooooooooo
'wwwwwwwwooooooorrrrrrrrrttttttttttthhhhhhhhhsssss

The odd creature continued to slowly annunciate as Todd tore into him with the Blade
The monster turned head to him opened his mouth and from a small pocket crevice lauched a dart

The poison instant paralysis it poured into his neck
Completely concious but free of pain & movement

The monster unfurled his dick from his fat mass and sprayed him down as spider its prey
_

Ben given the time by the distraction of Todd was down the hall 
He heard the feet first before he was able to distinctly know the direction


Two orgainic masses collided
One attempt'n to grapple by in shock was slimed by saliva slide'n off to tumble hard down a stair well

The lights already now all on & alarms blare'n

The pack of them already on him
No time for naught even a sign

'I give my good ar
Ben half made out before he was tazed down
USB more than 15 feet from the door make'n the hole

Keeper was she thought only a Legend
One of the prime whose sole desire was carnal
This enslaved him as a powerful pet to other Primes
A faithful watchdog

She knew now the tales were true
In such surety she made ritual 
Complete in sacrifice for the sake of another
Who bonded by both become the shrine of their light

The ceremony seemed whispered to her as was Miss
Guide'n her step by step time too precious to inspect the source

Blood & Sexual Fluids 
To create powerful sign

She lit a candle & the two began to hum
Jordan in pain so deep he felt his betrayal

The exquisite pain & pleasure pooled a potent power
Chaos worked into a designed charm by a prophetess

Before even the first drip of candle to create river down a side
A sound echoed stronger each tap

tap tap tap tap tap tap tap

A black form darted at them
Stuck settle'n on the warm candle wax

The message was clear & their flight at all haste

Todd & Ben would not be come'n back

_

They could not take the time to stop to get the bikes
Only flee as far from that build'n as possible
From all Downtown infested with these nests

Sun broke on early morn waves
Them heave'n sat back against the rocks

They kept in prayer & fast that Todd & Ben return 
#################################################

Decades later live'n wealthy on the ranch that was that Dune land
In a world released from the clutches of the Cult of Dagon

The information had been monumental proof of all vile documentation so prevalent by computers
Communication between parties was now preserved allow'n for a stable confident society

After 10 years a government task force privately bust in on the islands
Choppers of large government grade immediate assembled in parade

World Leaders then awarded the two as world heroes
Four of them etched a monument at both the Dunes and the pond of water

It wasn't till rust wore off the names
Did Todd & Ben ever get to pay respects to their friends
