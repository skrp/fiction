! Clank clak clik
Todd ran his hand down lockers lining empty-halls

15 Minutes past the Bell
Point-of-no-return to class

Any student this late gets writ-up
Ironically worse than not-arriving-to-class-at-all

`Devil has idle hands when works harvest
Todd inspired himself to no avail

His purpose in the basement
Below, front the door he planned to open 

Latency became mounted by endless-anticipation
Energy from day-dreaming now a hurdle
Aun compelled him towards the opposite direction

The thump of Todd's feet steady
Step-after-step up stairs to higher floors

A peace appreciated
In a place only-ever bustling

The few rays of the sun bore thru only to expose dust-polluted air
_

Mellow ambience shattered
Patters of running-feet charged towards his direction
From around the corner

Fortune placed Todd directly opposite the girls restroom

Distance leapt in one bound
He rushed to the last stall

Todd let out a cocky smirk
An instictual-ingenuity to hide in the girls

!! KAK

The cracked-seat broke plunging his left-foot ankle-deep into hour-old piss & shit

The door quietly opened
Someone made an attempt to open the first stall

A muffled-yell came from the hallway
'BEN WE KNOW YOUR IN THE GIRLS

!! BOOM

Heavy-legs-kicked-open-near-cracked-the-door-in-half

That unexpected fright broke unprecedented-pressure into full-release

!!! BRAPPPPPPPPPPUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSS
!!! PPPPUUUPPPPTTTTTUUUUPPPPP
!!! PPPPPLLLLQQQQQQIIIPPPLLLUUUUKKKKIII

The entire school vibrated
Eruptions of great-masses expounded essays in song

!!! GAWDDAMN BEN
!!! YOU SHOULDA SAID WHY
!!! YOU NEEDED tHe gah hiRls

A schoolhall-monitor hooted out for-the-entire-building-to-know
Announcement gagged-quiet
Gas particles bloomed-out in a thick cloud
_

The room silent after the door fell shut & resettled
All walls of the building rumbled again
This time in unanimous giggles

!! PAT
!! PAT
!! PAT

Ben kicked at the stall door braced-shut by legs
'Gonna make your fat-cunt-trap
'Eat that shit you scabby-bitch

Todd stepped out of the stall
'Back off

Ben turned to him more crazed

! YOU

Todd was swiftly tackled to the wall
Slamming hard as his soaked-foot slipped-out

Ben muffled as he struggled out his revenge
'You are the reason I got chased

'walk'n around
'like you weren't 
'skipping class

'a teacher notified
'the monitors and got me chased down

Todd maneuvered around using Ben's force against him
His forearms placed Ben in a locked-hold

After several curses & a long pause Ben surrendered
'Alright asshole
'You made your point

Todd pushed Ben off to a safe distance
A toilet flushed and another boy joined the scene in the girls restroom

'Sorry about that
Jordan blushed-out the awkward introduction
'Im sick

Today would haunt Ben's reputation
For a while they were content with breathing the compressed-gas in silence
_

Walls washed white layer-after-layer
Extenuated by dark recesses between the tiles
Unable to conceal deep-red marked graffiti symbols

Piss marked all to a feminine territory
If only the stain but mostly the smell

Curiosity here only met horrors
All repelled from investigations

Ben broke the silence
'This place is kinda creepy

Hot-box-gassed-up
No where to go until the class period ended

A sound tickled Todd's ear
An enchanting burr at the tail-ends of the echoes

Before he realized he was interested
Echoes drew him closer to the wall

Todd was startled then reaffirmed

'There is a hum
'That sounds like a whimper
'Can you hear it

Jordan put in as he neared
'Probably a god-damned-ghost

He yelled at the trash-can playfully
'School is hella-haunted
'sk-a-dick Bettsy burns-the-dick

'back in the 50s ...
Jordan started his story

The hum came from the metal-box next to the trashcan
Rust smeared as Todd opened the lid for better acoustics
The vent dropped to darkness

Todd spoke into the vent
'We can hear you

( need help help please help )

The sound came softened from great distance
But with a fullness-of-scream
That rips apart throat-lining

The communication so faint
Todd looked to the others for confirmation

( help us    please )

Jordan ventured
'Here
'we are here

'Where are you

( can you hear me  hello please help )

Jordan continued
'We hear you
'We will get the Principal

!!! nnnneeeeeeehhhhhhoooooooooooo

The shriek took all three back in a tight terror
Pitch-to-curl-ear-hairs in absolute revolution

Todd opened the lid with both his hands to shout down

'Who ever you are
'Where ever you are
'We will find you
'That is a promise

Todd left immediately
The others followed dazed

To them it seemed
A reckless commitment

At 10-min-to-the-bell the hall is at its most empty
Policy prohibits anyone out-in-the-hall

The trio made their way without obstruction
All Monitors would be back in their lounge on the couch

Todd led them confidently down lower floors

'I discovered a secret passage behind a door
'When I got lost my first-year fire-drill

'All year I been trying to work myself
'Up to this before graduation

'No chance ever came
'So today I promised
'I would make it happen

Todd was the only-one-he-knew who had seen that long-corridor
Despite years he still believed in what he had seen

'Since first-year
'I been planning how explore it

'Today is too much for coincidence
'That door will lead us there

Not to mention Todd felt empowered by company

Three boys followed the stairwells down
A small pack not-to-be-fucked-with

On-the-move breaking all violations
They were all-in since they left the girls

Crossed lengths of halls of the first year students

Todd continued
'When I got lost

'I felt someone calling out to me by-name
'I followed
'Tho less-than-a-handful knew my name

'I found a door at the end of the hall
'It was unlocked
'At first I only peaked in out of curiosity

'But at the back of the closet
'There was a light-source instead of shadow

'I had time to wander so I entered
'I discovered a long corridor

'The path went ahead for a long time
'It ended at a black hole in a wall

'I am sure it leads down
'But I forced myself to go back
'Before I got near enough to know

'Goddam-creepy-place

Todd looked ahead determined
The pent-up-forces now unleashed propelled him forward unstoppable

Thru the hall towards the basement
Moving around windows
One-at-a-time ninja-like
Till they got near the gym-lockers

Jordan expounded
Stirred with the brisk walk

'Shit-man
'Most my papers for school
'Were all about school history
'Lame-as-fk-mate 

'Yo tho 
'One caught me like

!daymn

'At center-city-library
'People all WTF
'You shoulda been there it was classic

'But the article caught me unexpected
'Bored, but try'n to look like
'I wasn't only there for the roof

'So Im thumb'n thru all these papers from the start
'To see when Driscol got famous the first time

'This floor is supposed to be the basement
'Right so with that-in-mind

'There was one article
'blow-your-mind-man

'A boy found pieced-up
'In a fishy satanic ritual

'Im like some lil muthrfkr
'Put this pulp in tryna-act-smart

'But !Daymn
'The newspaper was solid-legit

'The article said the janitor
'Alerted authorities from across the county
'They almost hung-up on him as nutt-case

'But the they heard him
'Get eaten da-fk alive
'Fleshy sounds & munching
'Huge masses of people chanting

'Man screaming 
'Kept alive past possible

'PoPo from all over the county stormed the place

'That shit all happened 
'according to multiple statements in the newspaper
'On the muthrfkn-second-basement floor

'First I took it considered Uni Hospital first-floor
'But then I remember from a previous research paper 
'This building only had two floors 
'Over ten years later the Uni was built over the school

'I tried to correspond
'But nah nothing man

'We are talking total-silence as in
'Newspapers from that entire month
'All gone missing

'She-it-son 
'That archive was a national data-bank

'Only the physical copy I was holding
'So I stole that shit & now its framed
'One day might be worth fat-wads

They were panting hard having crossed three-floors

Ben countered at the steamroll-logic
'I been here all 3 years of school

'If there were multi-basement-levels
'There would be some proof

'A reworked stairwell
'Modified to only move up

'I been on both sides
'Of the main Wells

'Those walls are as old as Miss Finely

Jordan added revrently 
'may-the-cunt-bitch-rest-in-peices

Ben kept speaking
'There would be structural-columns
'With three basements those pillars
'Cant just be erased off the structure

'fk-more-so
'All of our classroom-ceilings
'immigrant-mangled-patchwork
'From the Uni construction
'The Uni had way more money & that job still trash

'You both believe that a stairwell could just disappear
'These stairwells were created by god on the 8th-day for fks-sake
_

A closet door tucked to the exterior-wall at the far-end in the corner

Todd's sweaty palms slid on the locked knob
A narrow closet was exposed by the small window

'got-it
Jordan knelt in front took off his pack
Retrieved a pouch

The door was open and pack back on Jordan's back
Before the other two could follow the action

Once inside, after the brooms & mops
A corridor was revealed to turn down a very-long-hallway

The narrow corridor followed the exterior wall
_

Single-file in the errie-way of knowing an action would change life forever
Endorphins flowed in bounty of oft-asked-question revealed more than mundane

Ben admitted
'This is the real outer wall

'I always thought it was odd
'There were no small windows
'In any of the rooms in the basement


'The Fire Marshall
'Got the school on fire-code

'Rather than expose this wall
'They built that new northside-stairwell
'Whole week the Firemen escorted people up to the hospital
_

The walls made of the pilgrim-old-brick
Large, thick & dark-purple

The tunnel was bare
It held no purpose
No back doors to any classrooms

Only continued long-passage after long-passage

The end came up abruptly as a blank wall

Ben chirpped
'The architect must have been a comedian

Jordan countered
'Or hide access
'To an entire level in a closet
'Sure-as-shit-stick there was a fake wall to back that closet

'Pilgrims times
'The bay was too huge

'Before all them well-to-do-fk-you-fucks
'Bought up all bayside lands

'Back in the day
'This was a scary place to live
'Everyone with guns & knives

'Pirates raided every year
'Roy Miller Path
'Arcs right with this school at its head
'As far as any raider ever went
'Often to kidnapped kids

'Thats why we have that motto

'Once a Buc
'Always a Fk

Ben thought he knew school history
He only vaguely heard people talk of what Jordan said

Ben noticed on the old bricks
Symbols carved in peculiar diagrams
The sprawl of it was typical of angry graffiti

Todd had been busy searching for the door he now only-remembered

Todd's nails scraped against the wall
Along a fine-line found only after difficulty

Jordan moved him out of the way to work at it with a thin steel bar

Peeled-paint revealed a metal door
2ft above-the-ground 3ft high-and-wide

Jordan turned to them for-real
'She-it
'We get caught back here
'Gonna be us screaming

'Think some rag-hoe
'Next period hearing our screams
'Gonna do the same for us

'Best-recognize

'Might as well go all-in
'Right from the start

'Yall best act smart

Jordan patted his bar on palm confidently

Todd took the bar from Jordan
'Maybe I should hold onto that

Jordan only looked onto his hand
He felt completely betrayed by them 
So swift & sure Todd's action

Jordan raised an eyebrow
Content to let Todd do the rest of the work

They all helped pry the hinges into creaked-submission

Somehow Todd always knew this went down
Now he saw into the black depths

The door had the lock from the inside
It fell down the shaft in distant bangs for a long, long time

Jordan let out
'Pilgrims were paranoid muthrfkrs

Ben looked at Jordan
'Wouldn't you be

Jordan smirked back
'be? 

'Son Im worse
'My locks may bend
'But they never break

Ben didn't know how to place that remark
Unsure if Jordan was full of the shit his slang promised
_

Dark musty air flowed immediately to them & up
Strong-as-a-gulf-breeze
Hot as furnace vent

Something caught Todd's eye
He poked at it with the bar

Elevator-cords hung in the mid hidden by darkness

'If there are 3 lower basements
'Then there are only two floors to explore

An exchange of glances agreed compliance

Jordan looked casual
Ben looked like he would not back down

Todd reached with extended-arm and grasped the cord
'Reach out with both hands
'& Commit

He let himself be drawn into the darkness

He left them with a confident smirk
He was prepared for this

Todd fell to the deep
In an unstoppable rapid-slide

!!! HAILMARYFULLOFGRACE
_

All was dark
Distance only abstract 

Movement only testified by the-burning-of-his-palms
Sweat-sprung as will-fought-for-life

To grasp a frictionless cord as skin yeilded to muscles

Todd ventured his legs out
He managed to stop himself into near splits

'Thank-the-Father
He did morning-prayers today

!!! TODD
The other two screamed frantically down

Todd looked up
The door only a small smudge of silver
In the infinity of dark space


'Im okay
'Im okay

'There is oil on the cords
'I should have expected it

'Gonna take off my shirt
'Use it to hold wrap around my hands for grip

Ben asked automatically
Without idea on how to back up the offer
'Do you need help up

Todd fearless began to climb at a controlled rate
'Its best only one person
'Be on the cord at the same time

'Im gonna try
'To find a door
'To get to one of the floors
'I fell pretty far
'So Im guess'n up

Skin-peel-palms grateful-past-pain
For the cool protection of the shirt
_

Todd didn't notice any doors in the commotion down

The best course would be to climb up slowly
To ensure he could get back up

He would feel for the door with this feet
He spat out iron-tainted saliva
'Old oil

The slide down had cleared off most of the oil
His covered-hands now had clean purchase

Only sounds of his breath & swell of air

The gusts came intense, rising in heat from deep-darkness

Todd felt a gust on his stomach
It was cool & didn't come from below
He stomped out the outline of the door

! TWANG
! TWANG

A beam bore into the darkness

'I think

! I found it

With one hand he felt for a handle
The door was there, he could feel the cold metal

!! POMP
!! POMP

Todd stomped the corner down
He pulled himself higher
Kicking-down until the door gave way

He pulled himself into the dusty grey hallway
At the end of a long corridor

'Im off the cords
'Come down

'Wrap your shirt around your hands
'I will be here to grab you if you need it

Jordan challenged
'Best just stay back
'Something get loose and fall
'Right into your face

Ben & Jordan followed down & swiftly entered

Ben, last, climbed inside scraping his knee
Looking up saw Todd & shrieked back falling-on-his-ass

! FUCK

Todd was covered in dusk-caked dark-blood-mud
Blood not oil had been on the cords

Smears were left where Todd had touched himself
Jordan hadn't taken much notice of it

The silver of the dust seemed to repeat what available light there was
_

This level was an abandoned hospital
All lay as if it had been unexpectedly sealed off

Jordan could easily track with layers

They went forward in a cautious manner of adventure

Electricity still flowed on this floor
Emergency-signs gave enough light for them to move secure

Ben told them
'That shaft went way past the length two floors
'The hospital dumps the body-parts thru it
'But that explanation doesnt make much sense

Jordan continued
'It doesn't make much sense
'To have a hospital as a secret basement

'I expected a mid-evil sex-dungeon
'where-bad-kids-get-krumpus

'This was obviously abandoned
'While in full-service

'Not a single empty chamber

At the end of the first hall
Jordan looked into a room

On the bed was a familiar form

'Hold up

Jordan walked inside the room
Only a bed pan & a flipped-over bed
With a swift fling he threw off the blanket

A long decayed corpse lay there turnt-off the-fallen-bed
Sweet smells stung their noses

The horror was simple
No screams or fear of life

Only a complete confidence
Their life was in danger
_

A loud-clang, shuffle and meaty-wacks where heard
A hoarse voice rose but was immediately silenced

The source was distant

The boys took shelter in the room
A corpse for company

The day had long-since numbed their nostrils

Jordan whispered
'Doesnt make sense
'Water from the tap
'Electricity

Ben
! Snap

He took off his pack, using the blanket as tent
Plugged into power
Plugged into network

Jordan & Todd both third-wheel

Rather look at the corpse
Neither help touch it to make a tent

Its hair over-grown
Its jaw dangled stoopidly

Its hollow eyes held a truth
Mystery to present company

Someone was trapped & beaten in the concealed sub-basement of the school
The authorities would no-doubt do likewise to the trio of boys

The three huddled in a room on an abandoned-level layers from escape

An elevator shaft the only one known exit

Jordan an expert in these situations

Mousecraft
The sure way to go about these things

Patience & long-wait'n
Until absolute vacancy was established

For the entire period they waited
Bells could still be faintly-heard

The silence a time for meditation
Accept this drastic turn of Friday morn

Be ready to decide
Upon actions with dire-consequences
_

Their eyes & senses now accustomed they proceeded

Halls built in the same high-cieling-structure of their school
One large hall circled outside & inner arrays-of-rooms

All told obvious signs this area was not frequented

Jordan guided their search
He tracked the dust to know how long since last-passage

The inside of rooms always at highest-end of the vacancy-spectrum:
  untouched -> long-since -> this-month -> this-week -> today
_

Jordan led them to a path that was taken daily

One head-of-the-path led to a stairwell
They followed the other head towards a large-open-room inner-room

It dropped low into a deep arena
Workstations arrayed the entire space

Industrial-lamps draped over each stone table
Shiny-rungs glinted embedded as obvious restraint ports

Under each table
Various shelves for various instruments

Jordan's heart fainted

'All the tools
'In all these stations
'Down all the rows
'Had-been-used-recently

The only daily path led to a table at center-stage
The only table with its light on

Strapped to the table by a broad-leather-belt
Was a nude-red-headed-girl

So bruised was her face
Impossible to see her freckles

Freckles covered her entire body
Freckled to the point that
Tho bloody, bruised & nude
Freckles the first characteristic noticed
An infinite amount of cherry-colored-dots

She had stich-patch-openings all over her torso
Patches appeared in similar fashion all over her body

Her shut-eyes sprang into maniacal-alertness
Two large yellow-orbs

Three boys, not monsters, stood over her

Jordan was unable to free any strap
'How do we get these loose

Confused past-exasperated

'How
!daFKget
'These god-damn-straps-off

Yelling stupidly at the world but really aimed at the girl
Entirely realizing how idiotically loud he was

She screamed just recently
Now she won't speak to save her ass & theirs

Jewels looked back at him

She opened her mouth to display
A mutilated-stump-of-a-tongue-in-a-wag

The stump was fresh
It had an odd-seal as if it was seared

A small muffled voice came to fullness
'Finally sorry
'I could not speak
'Hardly-breathe
'When she lays like that

'Don't you move like that neanderthal
'I need to get ready to introduce us

'A hundred years will teach you patience bitch

Infantile hands pushed its way out of a tangle of hair
A creature emerged from her shoulder

A shrunken-head
Two baby-arms attached
Under shriveled-ears
_

The trio looked aghast
A monster perched on the girl's shoulder

'Yes this is a shock
'I understand ignorance
The little head said in a small voice

Jewels cast her face-to-the-side-ashamed
Nude & openly disfigured took over her predicament as most-painful

The little head made a-small-exasperated-sound
'How are you such a bitch all the time
'You expect these twirps to keep their shit
'With you crying about yours

'I can find you a new-tongue
'A longer one if you are into-that

'You had much worse
'Now no need to disrespect me

'Miss the Countess
Her hands gestured a bow & the little head tilted

~for-fks-sake
Jordan leant in between the two
! we-gotta-get-the-fk-outta-here

'The bands are one leather belt
'Hurry up
'There is not a second to spare
The head said quietly then paused

'Above our head you can release it
'Come on rodents not a moment to lose 

'Jewels can't speak now
'& I can't read her mind
'But I can sense what she is feeling

'She feels ashamed of me right now
The puppeted-head trailed on

Jordan found the clasp to be odd-shaped
Only after some ingenuity was it released

Only with the help of the metal bar & 6 arms

Jordan's shirt was the least dirty
Jewels wore it as a small dress

Miss had them make a measurement & a cut
To tailor the shirt to mold to her-form

The demeanor of Miss had an instant way to blind the truth
Interacting with her as to-an-adult

Ben's shoes didn't fit Jewels
Only his socks

Miss rapped Ben as he knelt to take of his shoes
The rod extended to a painful twang that resonated in his skull

'We need to hurry
'If they come back soon
'Each one of us will be strapped again
'All the worse for let

Promptly they made exodus out that devilish auditorium

The light had a cruel elderly-tint-of-aged-desperation
Its rays seemed to follow them in a-haunting-fashion as-if-pointing-direction
Vengeful that what themselves had accepted must be fated-true unto-all
_

The elevator cord now clean enough to allow them quick-access back up to the basement

Not till they reached the closet door did they recognize their predicament

Todd smeared all over in blood
Thin-streams ran down his face like bloody-tears
Jordan was shirtless
His odd-shaped-belly buldged-out
All were caked in dust
And finally there was Jewels

Ben admitted despair
'How the fk are we going to get out of school
'They are going to know where we have been immediately

'Put us back down here at all costs

Jordan wailed back
'Fk they will just say
'It was another god-damn-drill

'Shit happens like every couple months

'I have a plan
Todd opened the closet door & walked into the school hall

Dusty
Shirtless
Pantless
Bloody

They broke into the hall cast from horror
Sharply outlined to a monotony-of-normal-scenes
The view more contrast by their outlandish forms

Todd had a pre-planned route of exit

At the end of the hall a teacher stopped her lecture
She opened the door and yelled

!!! MONITOR
!!! MONITOR SECTION 7

!!! 459

The call for any who heard to plaster against hall-windows
A mosh-pit of greedy-kids starved for 1st-hand-account 
Only a limited section for viewing

Marinated in a day dreams from revels of the earlier shit-show

Several girls touted the hideous state of the infamous toliet
Some kid Ben had obliterated

Ben afterwards never found
As if he exploded instead thru his ass
Which became the legend

Tho diappearance was normal
The obvious ignorance of the faculty was rare

Up on lunch-meal-meds now in a riot
Each young-heart feral

The four spectated only by the larger-classmates
Teachers in this way were barred from looking out

Todd led them around the corner to rush up the stairwell

Two large Monitors stood as sentinels
Locked-down-in-protocol at the-main-exit

!!! MONITORS
!!! SECTION 1

!!! 459

Two voices boomed

Todd already turnt leading them across the level to stairwells

There was no time to explain
Only for Todd to choose and the rest to follow
_

Cross the school in this method
All Monitors would be drawn to the wrong location

Their exit was higher-up school-levels
Not at the ground-floor as expected
_

Every window filled
Every door blocked

Curious-children stirred by shouts
Starved-sights of spectation
Charged by an eventful-day

Teachers more scared of the fight-pits
Than to do their duty

This factor allowed the five
To the second-floor unhindered
_

Jordan pulled out his metal-bar
'Now is the reckoning
'Suggest yall wake-up likewise

Ben took the hint
He had a second-purpose for his laptop-computer & cords
All his files were stored on a USB drive

They passed the restroom of the morn
Towards the end of the hall

Todd took out a key from his pocket
He unlocked the window

'Just do what I do
'Go where I go

They climbed out onto a narrow ledge
The sun shone hotly on them
They burned under it with exhaustion

Four-odd-bodies outside on the second-story
The world outside too-busy-with-the-day to notice

The ledge continued to an adjacent roof
They crossed over to a high-branched tree

The branch overhung onto the roof in an entangled attachment

By that means they climbed down to ground-level
At the back of the school

Onward into alleys towards less-traveled roads

Each of the boys knew how to pass-this-area without-being-seen
They ran tired but now they knew this-stage was their-turf

They knew over what fences led where
Up which buildings to what

Rat-true
Now they could not get caught

Jewels only had a large shirt & Ben's sweaty socks
Ben carried her piggy back the intervals he could

Headed by Jordan, the other two at her side
This kept her mostly covered

Large-city-bustlers continued their way without heed
The four moved as a pack following Jordan's lead
_

They arrived at the edge of Downtown
Outskirts to the industrial-sector

Jordan turned them into an alley
& Thru a hole in a chain-linked-fence
He loosed it then bound it back

They quickly entered thru a locked-window
The edifice as dusty as the sub-basement

They cautiously followed Jordan's movements

Hopping from board-to-board
Their trace with few tracks

Up the stairs to a room

Jordan locked the room with a chain after they entered
He then pushed away a cabinet to reveal another chain-locked door

'This far from anyone
'Gotta be triple-sure
'So as to sleep

'Breakin thru one of these
'Loud enough to wake whatever sleep

An outside window exposed the endless ocean
Dust free & ocean breeze

Jordan led them thru the outside window
To a fire-escape covered by patched-tarps

The floor was of netted-metal

'Got a tank of rain water
Jordan pointed up

'Open the spout
'& Close it with this knob

Jordan motioned them to turn around

'Aint clear-water
'But cleaner than you

He took a brisk wash in water heated-by-the-sun
The water splashed far below

While waiting for Todd to finish
Ben asked Jordan
'So what is this place

He laid on the stitched-cardboard-mat 

Jordan looked-down as his face blushed
'This is one of the places I live
_

Refreshed & completely exhausted

All laid on layers of cardboard-stitched japanese-tatami

Ocean gusts massaged their tense skin
All slept passed-out-till-next-morn

In safe slumbers
Soothed by the-sound-of-steady-waves
_

They all woke in the daze of a new life
Jordan fed them dried fruit & granola
Washed down with Mtn-Dew

'Got locations like this
'City wide

'I can go any where
'And find myself alright in an hour

'Tho this one is the nicest
'Each has a stash of all I need

Jordan closed the container & stashed the food-box in the closet

'Last week I was stuck across town
'The food there must have went bad
'I was so exhausted I cant remember eating

Jordan finished looking apologetically at Ben
All that now mostly forgotten by the day

Ben realized his predicament with this father
His father would be ready with a self-righteous beating

It was Saturday-morn

From Friday-morn to now
The trance finally woken

Jordan had a rummage-of-clothes raided from the downtown charity

Jewels was head-to-toe with garments that mostly fit
She had hiking-sandals with wool stockings
The light-blue summer-dress only-a-little-too-short

That morn her & Miss  tailored the outfit
Repurposed-stockings for her forearms

Jills was very sensitive about her arms

Miss always held a finely-made extendable-umbrella
This would bar anyone from seeing what was quick-to-hide

Jordan now wore a pocketed vest

Ben took an old-leather-jacket
He tied in a roll under his pack

Todd took a set of wool gloves for his hands
They were very raw after his recleaning this morn
_

Jordan trailed their exit
Covering their tracks as they returned to the streets

'Take everything
'I never go to the same place
'In the same week

Ben needed to get to the payphone at the lower-district Circle-K

The day was warming to be hot

The heat relaxed overworked-muscles
Warmed after a prolonged-stiff-sleep

Ben looked at Todd
'We only have enough for one call
'You mind if I use it

Todd complied
'I am the last of our litter
'My parents wouldn't know if I was gone for a week

The pressing pace of life left Jewels & Miss still to be sorted out
They kept silent or to-themselves
_

After 4 rings
Ben tried the oldman next-door

The old voice responded
'Heeh Hello

'Mr. Grinvix this is Ben
There was no response for some time

'I just wanted to call to ask if you see my dad
'Tell him I'm on my way home

There was only silence
'He isn't answer'n the phone

Ben waited awkwardly
Only the sound of heavy breath'n

The old man finally spoke
'Your dad
'is dead boy

'You best get to the authorities
'an have 'em tell ya

The voice was sympathetic but immediately hung up

Ben stood silent leaving the phone to his ear
Flabbergasted from truth-revealed-lie

His dad would always be there

A jackass who tried hard to keep a light heart

To never-again hit him
Nor give him advice-no-other-could

A man regretful of being a father stuck with a son

Man enough to power thru that hardship
That too-often-than-not himself the cause

Ben physically-worked to come-to-grips
Understandings toppled down
Dazed among rubble

The four in silence
Left him space to wail
_

!!! PLUUPP
!!! PLUPPP

A police car had silently snuck up behind the crew
Its lights now bright at their backs

'Alright you juuhhhh

The cop cut short as the pack immediately bolted

He turned & fumbled open the door
Which he preemptively shut

Today was not a mood for the cop
'Im gonna bust diaphrams
'fkn-lil-shit-fks

The officer called into his shoulder-piece
'Broc here
'I got a 281 on that 459
'Update the 459 is now a 499

He reversed with sirens blaring
Empowered that the level 9 meant better dead
Confident he didn't need to look back

His focus-as-predator never dropping target

In that action he was fused into the building Circle-K

An overworked-trucker, backed by near a ton of Coca-Colas
An unstoppable mountain until about 15-feet into the store

Flesh crunched in sharp folds of metal
Soaking Dorito-chips like salsa

Drowning the cop
In a cold-death of Slurpee
_

Todd looked back in relief

That cop coming must have been the result of Ben calling his neighbor

The timing on the cop made sense if dispatched from Downtown-Station

He took them the back way uptown

What was this all about?
Did it have to do with Ben?
Or is this a result of yesterday?

The question caught his throat
Grateful of the many more steps still to take before an answer

Todd led the exhausted group up the hills towards his home 

Ben had not said a word
The group kept silence 

If the death of Ben's dad was related to yesterday
It would soon be known 

That horizon closer with each step & familiar-landmark
Silence prepares the way with comtemplation

The deep sleep of last night swept away traceless 

Now only entreched in labor with no timely solution
Now only the acceptance of pain as the-state-of-being

The five-miles drew two-hours time
Under sun unabated over a cloudless sky

Seagulls squaked 
Enjoyment the uncomfortable position of beings the gulls envied

Tables now turned to the birds favor
What is toilsome for humans a lesiure birds

The world continued careless
Inside cars disconnected from their momentary-coordinates
Distracted by the thought of the destination 

Four souls suffering & unable
To begin to voice the matters-at-hand

Their souls at full-capacity with the present journey

The made their way up hills that loomed over the Downtown bay
Favoring sidewalks with more shade

A once normal world betrayed as an alien-state
To a group so fused in the throes of turmoil
_

Miss broke the silence 
'I am Miss
'We have not formly met

'I already know your names
'No need to introduce again
'Tho it would be polite

The communication took time to digest
After the miles & silence of misery
They just continued dumbly

Miss paitent
'I have been attached by operation  
'To this girl Jewels who was offered
'As sacrifice to Dagon

'To introduce Dagon to the unanointed
'Is an oath-breaking death-sentence

'But I have the favor of the Seer
'So I may do as I please keeping-oathsworn

'Dagon is a cosmic god
'Infathomable & Unsaitable

'Earth is bribed to Dagon 
'As an occult offer'n by those of the
'Esoteric Order of Dagon

'A sacrifice of this world
'& All worlds connected by Quantum-Entanglement
'For the bounty
'Past imaginations which gods bestow

'All Earth will be consumed
'Drained dry as Mars

'Great powers lie in this cult's foundations 
'The blessings of omnipotent-powers-uncalculable 

'Some envision the gift of infinite-life
'Indesuptably to be as god themself

'I am one of those in faith of Dagon
'All is worth in exchange for a god's blessing

'Jewels is the daughter of a wealthy family

'To pay the price of a family to join 
'The prime of their seed must be given 

'Truthful it is an honor not a curse

'I am 400 years old
'But only a year as symbiotic member of this girl

'As payment into the order 
'The past must live as youth

'Don't be fooled 
'I offer much

'I heal her & repair her
'Myself surgeon centries-in-experience

'I guarntee her life till old age & wise counsel

When Miss traveled to other parts of the body she burrowed
A fleshly-lump the size of a small-ball that moved under skin 

The right shoulder is her preferred perch 
She talks there with the baby-arms holding the umbrella
A shell that Miss tucks away into Jewels shoulder

'We worship the bowels of Dagon

'In Jewels was inserted divine-microbials
'This the digestion of the gods

'When I was an old woman we found the asteroid

'Tales of Eastern-Monks who under-tourture
'Guided us to a prophetized mountain-village

'Prophecy built on ancient astrology 
'& Deep-cosmic-mathematics could not compromise 

'Decades after mining to the asteroid
'Lead to unprecedented discoveries

'The asteroid contained mavervelous gifts 

'The Mound-of-Excrement of Dagon 
'Holy-be-it-Enternally

'Sadly only this small mass of me was left
'When the bateria-microbials were adjusted to our needs 

'These microbrial bacteria enhance the host 
'Bacteria sentient of the well-being of the host as life-itself

'Jewels is stronger than all you boys combined
'Microbials refine all ingestion & assimilation 

'I myself was the first generation to live with prepared hosts
'Viceroy Countess Miss of the Prime Circle 

'If that name doesn't get you out of a pinch
'At some future point when your life is on the line
'Then Imma whores-wet-nurse

They kept to the sidewalks with the most shade & least people
The day was hella-hot & the boys burned pink

Gusts would drown out her voice
Perked of interest they walked close together as Miss's voice did not carry

'I would proclaim 
'Jewels owes us much 

'But she is a foolish girl
'Gets youthful emotions 

'Yes Jewels is foolish
'Myself always busy 
'Patch'n up what she self-inflicts

! WACK
Jewels back-handed Miss

Miss mumbled sorrowfully quiet for a time
! PFT

'Well-I-never-in-my-life

After a few blocks
Miss regained her full-compsure

'Tho 
'I am sympathtic 

'To her need to be kept
'From our modular fashions

'The inner-circle ordered her to be pieced
'Into a more sensibly-modified-being

'The operation was for this morn 

'Jewels is held by us as a priestess
'Name annointed Jewels by the Seer 
'Who fated her to rise above the most high

'The freckles on her body
'Make-up a map to constellations

'The coordinates to a universe
'That attracts the best quantum-possibilites in all situations

'The Order will seek her out because she is this map 
'This skin even-as-leather will leads us to that universe 

'Freckled-patterns can not be captured 
'The freckles shift & move
'As if this location is transient
'Some sphere which settles in favorable situations

'A true Eden to rebirth our Quantum Entanglements

'Only by the boon of Dagon
'After this world is consumed 
'Is it possible to fulfill the godsent-command
'To arrive in a Space-Of-Best-Blessings

'Understand this 
'Her future has such consequence
'If her skin was lost to the Order
'It would mean the end of this most-unique possibility

'Powers like currents have drawn Jewels
'First to wealth, then to the Order
'Now away from the Order
'It is my suscpicion that many would rather guard leather
'Than this girl who has such free will

Jewels red hair caught the beams of sun
A royal beauty that no patchwork could mar
The strange girl who even now drew them together
Men would cat-call out to her & women would envy

Miss continued after they crossed the street
'Only one of our Entangeled-Possibilities needs to reach this destination
'Fate the power which will drag all divergencies to realigned perfect trajectory

'To trust in the power of Fate
'Future to have power to change the past

'The sacrifice of all
'As payment for all to attain
'A more perfect existence

'Our order alone
'Decides for all 
'In solemn manners

Commerical zones now faded to residential streets
Schools, graveyards & empty-lots

Miss stayed herself a while 
Jewels needed to regain strength
It was not easy for Miss to talk while Jewels walked 

'The Esoteric Order of Dagon 
'Dates to mankinds earliest history 

'Trends have taken its symbolism to idolitary 
'Fools will be pretensious 

'The Image of Dagon
'Alone necessary 
'To wield unobstructed power 

'Molecules bow to will
'Exerted in presence of that Image

'I myself am a prophetess ordained by the Seer
'The Seer secretly entitled me
'Follow paths by accordance to Jewels

'But the force of the whole-cult 
'Too much to stop

'Someone so imporant must be improved as insurance
'Every day new demands which I alone could not save her

'The thunder of your friend woke us 
'Providence gathered all that morn 
'To rescue us out of an unbreachable-system 

'Knights & heroes pale to the deeds 
'Which you have yesterday fulfilled

'It only at the cost
'Of only half a tongue

Miss proclaimed as if that a blessing
Miss was odd company to have 

The only thing pleasant
On the long stretch to Todd's house

======================================================================

The sun hot in the hour before noon
Lights were on in Todd's house

Todd burst in heart-in-throat
Eyes readjusting to the different-light

The smell of the outside
Inside the house 

The windows were broken
Leaves whipped-up under family-portraits

Forms of countless-cats at once were made out infesting every shadow
Suddenly the felines sprang into a frenzy

A large Calaco immediately charged Todd 
The heft of it large muscles buldging-tense

Todd had two-smarts-on it
A kick & a snatch

Each of his siblings had owned a cat
He pwned these mangey-cunts

10 cats stopped the attack
None of them cared to risk the same demise of their leader

Which act was duplicated repeat & repeat
Calaco a goolike-mash-upon-the-walls

The pulp of it arose any kitty salivate
So exquistely-rare the cuisine

Quelled-up with great fear of the rampage 
Despite all several stopped for a quick-taste

Cats swarmed over something on the maternal bed
Most of the body was chewed up but it was his mother

Todd began vomiting in the habitual direction of the restroom

Huched-face-first-ass-out across the toilet
Past-prime-pickings now only a gluttonous-feed
The mass of his father

Todd cleared out his home
Macabre painted in stern-rigtheousness 

The corpses of his parents foamed out of each mutilated orafice
Grey puss foamed over the lines of each scratch

No cat-claw could pierce Todd's thick wool-gloves
_

Neighbors came out to witness the loathesome scene
Guilty & in fear of the boy they all betrayed

None with courage to venture near
Two basketball-players died so horrendous
The twins on the way home decided to aid the shrieks
Consequence, puss-filled choked-dead in the middle of the street

The police came but did not interfere
_

After the last of the cats
Past tears 
Todd left the house
Bathed in warm guts 

Todd would use his might to bust the belly
Legs-to-legs above his head 

Cats in lunacy avoided the same fate
Busy in actions which often brought them the same 

Gloves a relic 
The thick wool golves perfect for pussy-busting
Raw flesh able to breathe
Yet protected from all-else
_

Cats have 9 lives
But they are their own-worst-enemy

Cats take too long to do anything 
Contemplating calculated actions aun to their demise

10s of bodies litered the rooms 

Jules could not walk fast in sandals
Jordan & Ben decided to give Todd his space

Near 100 disembowled-bodies trailed Todd's direction

Over short distance the cat is quick
Over long distance mankind reigns supreme

Aun to naps the cats put-off-guard 
Awoken too late by the scent of gore dripping off Todd 

Over-fence, thru-yard, along-country-road, over-cemeteries, thru-fields
Until finally rocky bays of ocean 

Rock-to-rock in hops 
Crashing waves below

Cats moved with agility 
But Todd still much faster

Todd climbed up birthed in gore 
Only one entry into a thicket-walled-island

The twist'n narrow-tunnel opened up to a vast expanse 

Antiquated farm-equipment
Animals of a rare variety
Fire-pits with altars 

One solitary hut built large as a warehouse 
Loomed in the center

Tatched roof to sustain hurricane winds
The edifice had a lifted concrete-foundation

A large bonfire-pit in the center of the circular lot 

The cat with the first warning-message only-just-returned
 
As if only to Todd introduced to as Reaper 
He entered the presence of the Witch 
A mess of steaming-mass vengence unsaited

Crafty & full-of-guile is an old witch
The sight of him froze her dead heart

Slow is man to be slain barehanded
_

When the three finally caught up to dunes
The cats would not near the area

All sat outside
In a countless ring

Too-tired from their massive trip to move
The group had to step over all the cats

Todd was off to himself 
All content to a corner 
_

Jewels stomached her way around the witch's hut
Parts of the witch were so-scattered-such she prayed it due-to-hungry cats 

Leatherbound tomes laid upon altars under balconys
Each balcony with a bonfire-pit
Great iron-pikes stood to hook a cauldron
_

The city was out for them
No where to go but where they were

The supply of the Witch enough to last years
Water piped from a resivoir the size of a pond 
It was kept lifted & covered
Fed by passing torrents

Firewood came pentiful off ocean drifts
Three weeks went by with even less words between them

Each kept to their own interests alone
Each front of the plentiful fire-pits
_

Jewels absorbed herself learning the ways of the Witch
Ordained with life's calling

Weeks in the study of the tomes
Prolonged-deduction of the state of each pit

Symbols, parts & bowels, mixtures & brews

Miss created a sheild-like-tome bound by iron
Four-tomes, two-wide two-tall

Leather-pages made from the thin flesh of the abundant dead cats
_

Jordan spent the time in exploration 

The excellent situation of the island
Built from foundation to be off-the-grid
Preserving better utilities than County
Isolated by many other like-islands nearby
Appearing to be as un-traversable with thickets as the others

A worn rock cliff dropped off to mellow-deep-ocean-waters 
One leap would exfoliate ones skin in deep-cleanse

Sea life was plentiful & transient
Jordan now satifisfied his ultimate-desire
Self-sustenance upon fresh meat killed by his own hand
_

Ben & Todd in similar circumstance
Understood each other as entirely divergent based upon their reactions

A global power now aimed to get them at whatever cost
Sent cat-assassins of wiccan conjury
Ben's dad murdered in an unknown way

The price they had paid for their decisions were heavy
_

The song of every bay 
Existence ever in seasons
Day after day
Today is only
Just another day

Todd & Ben both well-healed in time
In the careful-ways of slow-healing

Ben powered his laptop to the solar-power-station

Todd kept day-long meditations, prayer, & exercise

Jordan lived in peace as if finally repaid from turbid years 

Jewels shielded with an enshrined Tome

Miss ever diligent to guide & grow Jewels talents into abilities

Driscol now permenantly-closed
All students transferred to different schools

The five learned these facts back in town
A month had passed since school was closed

5 girls had gone missing after all the chaos
One girl was rumored to have shit in the same restroom
The smell so terrible the janitors refused to clean it

The other girls were all over the age of menstration

An outbreak at the hospital cost the lives of dozens of patients

Police could only evacuate patients to other facilities
Due to the pure-madness of the chaos

Rumors of monsters & fish-people

The past month had been chaos on the city
Under worldwide spotlight 

Most everyone kept consistent in the news
They split up on different sides of the street for fear the city was on the look-out
No story ever brought up that there were four teens wanted
_

Jewels & the cats kept to each other fondly
Cats avoided Todd at eyesight

Reveering Todd with gifts only as he slept

Dead rats, fish, crabs
& Plenty of money & chains

Todd took to a massive religious-piece
All made in gold large-enough-to-wield
The heft of it a precious-relic

Feline robbers stashed funds daily
In payment for fresh fish Jordan caught & Jewels prepared
All after the manner of the Witch

Jewels learnt all their names
& Kept a ledger for their transactions
_

The lengthy-trip to the city took half a day

The store was a feast paid for by the cats 
They stuffed their packs with supplies 

Sacks of food were tied to their packs
chocolate twinkies bread peanut-butter cheeses dried-meats pasta
_

Baytowns pull in lost-loiters world-wide

Each soul on drift with the tide
Drawn to far-away spheres

The library sat on the hill 
Homeless hobos just below

The Library kept an overgrown field to the back 
The lot left alone as a wild thicket

No-homeless succeeded in making any part of the thicket habitable 
Vegetation a fresh-density even fire would fail to conquer

Unknown to the city the lot had open-access to the city water
A river of water from a pipe flowed thru it & continued to the town

Fuel in limitless supply & limited-area 
The location was dense & impassible
_

At the turn around a corner-side-tree
The five entered the shadows of the lot

Jordan lifted a bush-arm that revealed a small path 
He stopped to turn & look at them
Jordan's characteristic move that meant something serious

'I really feel sorry for you
'Trust me
'I do

'But keep the bitching down
'There are hobos all around

Crawling, packs-first thru a maze 
The trail looked to be made by a rabbit

The walls were too narrow for an adult
Most movements snagged in unseeable ways

Relentlessness if tried true rewarded a scathed-body 
To open paths of civilty

After 45min they reached the end of the snake-like-way

Sidewalk neat as a tunnel ran under a netted-canopy-roof 
Aun light could not penetrate the canopy

The pathway walled by lamp-posts that were lit
It lead to a shed at the end
_

All bled

Jordan said to their bewilderment
'I put those thorns in myself

!!! WHAT

'Alright-fk-off

'I was much 
'Much bloodier
'Each scaring day
'Than you are now

'That took me 
'All winter & five jackets

'But look what we got to ourselves
'A fkn-fortress 

!daymn
'Love being forced to make that path
'A way too terrible for anyone else
'But the person who knows the end

No one was in the mood to buy into-that-reasoning
_

Dim-lights lit the completely-enclosed concrete-path 
Miss admired-always for her cheery-perspectives

'Above look 
'The foundation of this canopy

Miss pointed her shaft up at a metal line

'These heavy cords
'Attached to the posts

'All for that darned Carnival-DesMondes

'If there weren't such 
'Death to the tale I'd call it a-hoot-ta-boot

'Arrogant-migrant-workers disrespected the tropical-storm
'City warned them 
'tsk-tsk

'Only-just set-up-just-drunk 
'When the storm struck that night 

'Torments built into a Hurricane 

'From different-lands is different-fish 
'As we say

'The hurricane rearraged this area but these cords held strong 
'They are the foundation for this thick canopy

'The only thing left of DesMondes
'No worker nor machinery left afterwards
_

The path led to a utility shed 
Power & water & network

'Fort Thickets
An intricatly-carved-log branded the lot

Miss continued
'This place forgotten the years that followed Huricane Karma
'I remember having walked by it 
'How the years hide their gems

'Two-years after Karma
'Only Univeristy Hospital kept open 

'That is why University Hospital has unparalleled off-the-grid-independence
'It is the host of the entire-regions-network

Ben jolted
'The entire region 
'Networked to the same place
That is why all his route-tracers returned bogus-information

Jordan explained
Bringing the focus back
'My grandpa worked here 

'On a research-project on our ancestors
'There were several fotos of my grampa

'Taken a different parts of this place 
'Several for all the Fairs
'At the time there was grass up to the street

'I spoke to a librarian about the place

Jordan pointed to a framed paper on the wall
'Ganked that piece at the Library

The old schematic was the original building plan for the utility shed
_

All took comfort in the utilities
There was a makeshift shower built for privacy a hose & a drain
Welcome after the rural lifestyle of the island

Yet missing the comfort of fire
All together in the only room

Cabin Fever a bite of polar difference

Jordan rationed the supplies 
The others complied understanding
So hard now the passage of life
No longer able to gorge to full-belly
All only ever consumed in moderation

Jordan last to sit
Decided now tell his story 

'One night past-midnight
'Stuck on this side of town

'Crackhead-muthrfkrs 
'Everywhere tween here & Industrial

'Cold-front storm hit unexpected
'Rain soaked everywhere without four walls

'The security guard saw me 
'Loitering and maybe crying 

'He called me inside
'Let me stay until his shift ended at 6am

'I ate half of his lunch 
'I was so cold I drank an entire pot of coffee
'Never could stomach the taste before

'Man I wanted to bathe in the sink so bad
'But that would have freaked-out the guy

Jordan looked to the others
In confirmation the action was non-conventional 

'Coffee kept me in good-spirits 
'Snuck out with that building-plan

'I used pure force 
'Couldn't stop the pursuit until I arrived
'Literally

'The rain didn't breach the canopy 
'As long as I tunneled I was dry & warm

'Rabbits kept the path distinguishable
'Much easier to get thru back-then

'I had to brute-force some parts
'Hell quarter-mile crawling
'Switch-backs & shit 

'I knew the shed would still be there 
'If only four-posts & a ceiling

'But as you can see it kept good-condition 
'I did some trimming but the pathway 
'Kept neat naturally
_

The four rested on japanese-tatami-cardbord

Electricity filled their time 
Carefree life begs obsession

Ben took a trip with Jules to return with the computer
This place more stable for electronics
Code now everpresent on the network

Now understanding the occult fundamentals of how the regions network was established
Overtime he was able to find the patterns in the gateways of packet-traffic 

The direct link to network allowed him to forge packet addresses
A large amount of traffic passed thru the Library as bridge to the inner-city
_

Ben used his network skills to secure them deals-around-town 
rides, chores, grocery

When they needed odd necessities 
Ben would find various people to do them

He would pay them with maps-to-cash 
The delievery would throw the loot in an opening of the vegitation
Thorns were especially thick as a barrier as to only be accesible from the trail

Ben collected many names with reputation
These he manuevered to get what he needed

This first deal consisted of transistors, pop-tars, Mtn-Dew ...
The guy offered to throw in an 1/8 of shrooms & marijuana

Ben mistook the slang & accepted 
The well-tipped-delivery planted the stash gratefuly in the paper bag

After the drop-off Ben sent in him the location of the payment
'$100 taped in the bottom of a bench

Reputation first & big payments where necessary to garner trust
After the initialization, the process went clockwork-smooth
_

Jordan oathed them all to wait for an hour in the bush before entering
One of various imutable oathsworn protocols

Ben had been grabbing data from the archives at the library 
He stored them onto drives he implanted in computers across the city

With the cat's money he accumulated a mainframe in the shed
It constantly whirred in activity

The whir greeted him as he opened the shed door arms-full-of-supplies

Jordan immediately popped up surprised 
'Who ordered the weed

'Jewels will like those
Miss said overlooking Jewels rummage 
Rod perusing thru the items

Jewels recently irate that she didn't have a new tongue
Miss replied tartly
'Tongues don't just grow-for-the-pickings
'Where am I to get a suitable source & workstation

Cats everywhere except around Todd
They had their own, quicker paths

Jules would exchange with the cats 
Pimping new cats nightly
Eact arriving with an offer

A mixture of perfume 
Cakes to fill them with energy
For sex, strength or intelligence
Or just skull-fkd-delight

The once decimated-ranks rapidly grew & grew
The Witch had focused on communication for controlling the cats with orders
Jewels expanded on it with ways to express mutual interaction
_

Blood is thick with identity
Composition stirred by emotion

Blood magic draws strength from those wells 
They drank the brew of shrooms & blood-dreched-mint leaves

Mixture worked together by Jewels into a pact of blood
Bound together in rites

Naturally they sat in a circle
Accustomed to the fires of the island

Trance-State-Jewels formed an intricate DIAGRAM
The symbol encompassed each individual as part of the whole

'May the blood split
'For affinity to the other
'Bind us five more tightly

Each as corners
Arms the connection between
Legs to stablise as anchors 
Eyes each into the other 

The vapor off the aroma
Weed inhaled as incense

The hot brew in their stomachs digested slowly

Cauldron laid center-circle boiled over Jordan's stove 

Hours-upons-hours
Moon till noon
 
Their movements all-surfing-on-the-same-wave
In-tune at different positions of the swell

All looked at the other in reknewed understanding
Familiar whispers assured strengthened bonds 

Hands together bound by a rope
Jewels voicelessly passed them thru the struggles discomfort

Miss recited
'Comfort a sacifice
'We care for each other
'This pain binds us tight
'We reap true bounty only together

After the hours of fasting 
Cleansed-via-vomit

They took their always-packed-packs & left Downtown

Instead of the left turn towards the Dunes
Jewels lead towards her old school Uptown

Miss began her story
Sure of Jewels purpose

'At this school the Duties
'Are old-dike-identical-twins

'I am sure you have heard of them

'Boot-stomping-bruisers
'Bristly as an english-boar

'So loud their march
'Impossible to take them seriously
'Assigned to troll at Ray High 

'After decades passed the women were finally put to the test
'An abductor, of no small size, attempted an idea that would end his life 

'The jarhead beaten to death in a half-hour-struggle

Ben interrupted
'Yeah I've seen that
'Faces of Death covers the last-leathal-10-min-of-the-brawl

Miss hooted 
'After that everyone knew not to fuck with the Twins
'The Hollywood film still tops charts

'Old age has its toll
'3:30 - 3:45
'Neither can keep their eyes open
'The lure of that sweet rest into blissful wakefulness

'If you see two woman coming at you
'Jewels begs you to drop the bikes & run
 
'We have five minutes lets go

! WHAT

'We came here to steal bikes
'I didn't have time to explain
'But a warning is all you need

'Pick one fast & quiet or get face-stomped

They dove in the lot 
Snuck under the booth 
On-que slept the two

Every action was worrisome for them 
Jewels stitched & unseeming passager

City authorities already on the alert to get them
This venture had to pull off smooth
Stressed persperation bloomed from their palms

Lot of bikes were open for choosing  
Unchained due to confidence in the Duties
Whom knew the owner of each bike

big small large brite pimp
A selection unparalleled by any shop

Several bikes at front at gold-painted rack grouped together
All other bikes allowed respectful space

Jules went immediately & lifted the foremost-bike on her off shoulder 
She held the pedal with her hand

Miss chripped
'We are ready hurry hurry rats

Her bike was a tricked-to-shit bmx bike 

Todd took a practical road-bike after a measurement-mount
Looked sturdy after a decade of use

Ben hoisted up a rugged mountain-bike
The puffy tires had a relentless attitude

Jordan was sweating under his load

! are you shitting 
The four whispered in unison
The pimped out bike was ostentacious

Here wasn't the place to debate
They swiftly headed out

Following Jewel's hand motions
Silent directions to keep the bikes from making noise

Unobstructed back out on the streets within 5 minutes

After the corner turn they shouted & hooted
High-speed down-hill
Top-speed

Blasting out onto the coastline
The four bikes bullied lanes

Jordan on a lowrider bike 
All set in chrome
Lights-pimped-with-gadgets 

His kicked-back-position drew his left lip in coolness
His pack bound to top of the rear tire

By the time they came off the high from the brew they were bayside 
Front bonfire under night-sky at the Dunes

They could only piece back the earlier events
Greatful of the plunder 
Busy taking notes on the insights given to them by the shrooms 

Todd noted all their dealings in a record which he kept without fail 
_

Jewels never kept from work 
Wrote down the brew she made Miss memorize
She dried the fresh herbs brought in

Able to act free alone on island
All attention to the moment

Each lost & gained much worth longlasting-contemplation 
Lonely states allow the soul to be susceptible to higher states of being
Re-enforced by need to rebuild the rubble of demolished states of being

They all stared at Todd's replication of the DIAGRAM Jewels had drawn
She replicated it on a virgin part of the dunes at South-Moon

The DIAGRAM was singular in fashion & make
Magnetic bonds pulled them tangibly to sit in their placements

The sand would shift without breeze to form acute angles

Miss began
'This was contact of other beings
'Attracted to us via quantum-entanglement

'All are connected by quantum-bonds to kindred spirits
'Which inhabits spheres impossibly-far from here

'The bond is a constant proof of the infinity 
'Distance is of null impact when in quantum-state

'The bonds drawn in sleep
'Experiencing lives of others as Passangers

'Dagon

'His echo from AEons       
'His might truth

'Nations seek to call him forth as a gateway to divine gifts
'Tho all their world stripped upon his arrival

'The distance that seperates the cosmos is unfathomable

'Quantum properties testify 
'All realities that can pass will pass

'When one acts it creates possibility-nexi
'The more divergent the possibility the stronger

'One creates universes
'& Reworks destiny thru action

'Possibility-Severance occurs when two-liknesses diverge to irrevocable-paths
'Cases have been made for two sects: Chaos & Order

'The distance tween cosmos is unbreachable 
'Aun for the Holy Dagon

'Each life has the power infinitely stronger to breach the barrier of distance
'To contact the other thru human spirit consortium that makes up our bonds

'All hearts to power the other in a robust network
'That act together but physically alone

'This power when grouped by massive actions
'To entangle a being so greatly that the presence must be
'More powerful than Magnet, Gravity, or Love
'Can open the portal to allow Dagon God thru
'Pulling him as Schrodinger's Cat

'Thru ancient traditions passed down by the ages
'Evidence found on ancient-asteroids

'We reknewn tonight
'The Artes of Occult Cosmos Projection

'A rite learned & perfected to directly communicate across realities
'Experience to be shared across universes 

'This DIAGRAM given to us is the public gate 
'Our private understanding & connection with the symbols 
'That is the key to authenticate the intention 

'If we are lured by dangerous hands
'Symbols will betray the trap 
'These you seen form clearly

'Each is their own-worst-enemy
'Each in an Order of Ourself
'For Chaos or Order 

'These symbols associated daily 
'With their emotional attachment

'Symbols tattoed on flesh
'Took upon when the emotion hits
'This gives the power when the symbol writ

'A symbol will reveal Chaos or Order

'The Five of us strong together
'Each as corner for other

'Our rite will be our position we assumed during the shroom-brew
'We will bind our hands & sleep 

'By purchase of comfort
'We attain a way to project to other realities
'Casting our mututal connection there that others may unite

'Able to learn on a scale of infinity 
'Which will all confirm singularity in a situation

Position tho uncomfortable laid-natural
As if only a nudge dropped them down full-swing

All woke each in a different quantum reality

All the world under a dome of earth 

Illuminesent-roots dangled dripping light from the roof 
The plants glowed in shining marvels layered the ground
Each uniquely-florescent in liquid mathematical-patterns

A boy swinging a giant sword which passed thru all uncontested
Plants burst a cool slushy tastfulness of sticky goo
Todd sure it an intoxicant

Each bite was gorgeous 
None allowed any sense of fulfillment

The movement was hurried but anchored in a pace of endurance  
A steady of subborness that carried a hopeless-heart
Defeated yet unable to change course

He stopped to make hand-signs & speak
'My dog

'I need to find my dog
'Voice is passed to you

In any dream prior Todd could never distinguish himself
Now there was a clear-headed distinction of two presence

The boy stopped to make a impatient-questioning-gesture
Jordan came to mind

'Dogs
'Dogs logically gravitate 
'Towards high corners in a dome
'Like the one ahead of this gorge

Todd spoke but the words were Jordan's

'Echoes will seem to originate from each large-corner 
'The corners will draw the dog naturally 
'Each path you make will leave a trace 

'Your hack-n-slash tunnel will be easily distinguishable to the dog
'Your scent is carried in all this goo that drips off you

'The more corners you check
'The more opportunites for the dog
'To come across & catch your scent

Unexpected to a sudden bloom of hope
Joy burst in the boy from the epiphany

As a laugh in a quiet-room
Todd severed from the spurt 

Todd lurched up-ward still-cuffed

000000 BEN    000000000000000

Darkness 
Darkness but a candle

He was turnt towards black-walls of glass
Partitioned by of different colors of ASCII text scrolling down 

Hands worked fast over many keyboards 

Keyboards laid all over on the massive workbenchs facing the wall
candles memorabilia wax research-papers code books 

Lurching around in rolls
The man would wheel him-self about
Automatic-habitual-paths

clickity clack clak 

Colorful code displayed on various terminals
Each reviewed over & over

Ben could follow and understand some logic
Tho alien-syntax machine interaction only 1s & 0s

Characters would pour down the wall as waterfall  
Each to fill him with satisfaction never-so-deep

The man would scan then immediately push-on to the next station  
Searching for anomolies or only for the satisfaction of work done

Ben digested the code & commented passively
The man gave no immediate signs of listening
But at times a slight pause of typing to adjust to Ben's ideas

'Give me guidance 
'I have gone
'As far as I can 

The man grabbed a well-used box-vaporizor tube on the bench
Ben recongized the smell of marijuana

With a swift habitual movements his hands made signs

Thumb connected to last two-fingers
Second & Third up hard

sun-pose => fall => inhale-smoke-rise => hand-sign => lower-exhale

The man took a razor 
He cut out a symbol in the wood of the workbench

His got off the chair to step backxx i panorama
Went to the printer to grab a blank sheet of paper

What looked like artwork was revealed a diagram

Ben's eye jerked open 
Darkened by Todd's-shadow-siting-up

The fire longsince-burnt-out 
Ben was cold under a bright moon

Work 
Every second dragged

New customer
Same complaint

New room 
Same mop

In & out 
Dreary-life

Forced to system with no escape

Pentance
Guilty of poverty

~Believe in yourself
~You can survive alone

~Take heart & leave this all behind
~Your older brother can go to hell

Jewels was radiant
Under sunrays that sparkled off her light-amber-hair

Her eyes emeralds
Her tongue wet 

The bike hopped 
Rail-to-wall-to-flip

Sparks trailed her as she grinded on a bench

The person shouted partly aroused 
There a deep well of sexual desire

He looked down a roadbike-cleats 
Clicking metalically back to the bike

00000000000000000000000000000

All awoke together but all felt the exit natural 

Time was null
Dimension past traditional lines of perception

'This symbol here 
Ben redrew the polygon sign the man etched in the work-bench

'I want that tattooed across my knuckles

Jewels poked with a sunbleached fish-bone
Steadied-by-her-lack-of-empathy-for-pain

Dipped in root of an herb & ink of octopus 
Peppers & other mixtures to accenuate the fine lines

The symbol beautifully portrayed upon Ben's left-fist
Augmented by the artistic-mastery of Miss 

A simple-but-intricate masterpiece
The black-symbols turned to light-brown-red under the sun

The project became an ordeal which never stopped
Symbols & Shapes expounded from knuckles up the arm
Amplified in patterns of certain-dreams
_

Friday night 
Sabbath of longsufferring-adventures

Night prior fumed rites of sativa induced sleep 
Dunes Friday dawns before a closing-bonfire

The nights were warm
Felines in hundreds lay on them
One moved off to be replaced by another

Blanket of warm-fluffs
Connected the five 
In a web of heat

Wakeful dawn tides set calm-stages 
Passive scenes for their pre-planned actions 

For Todd that first meant warm-up then exercise
Training & habitualizing his body in Oriental Techniques

Dr. Yang-Jwing-Ming had taught him the fundamentals & forms
These forms he would practice then move on to shadow-boxing

The others were always very helpful to spar against
Each had their own style of agression
Jewels was a clever brute force all-in push
Jordan only ever defensive, while Ben grappled

Ironic as that time in the girls the day they met was the only ever win
Ben now had mastered the counter to Todd's technique with a greater vice

Two hours left his body exhausted by his mind awakened
His prayers were coupled with yoga poses

Prayers were contemplation, mantras, readings, writing
Western praktice of sacrifice harded his core with repitition & resilence

Philosohy & sciences oriented his decisions always to gravitate to a larger reason
Most decisions in life have no bearing as to selfish abstractions good, evil or neutral
Best to ensure a loss as a sacrifice, suffering laid at altar of a conception
_

Adventure returned them always to the city
Flock migrations in tune with the season

Spot to spot to spot
All knew the destination
If seperated they all would meet at the next spot

Each had a pack of their core items
Each location had accumulated stashes
_

Miss kept on Jewels to grown her own plants

Power of plant-magik
Unlocked thru engeries of service given to the plant
Sexual-pain in orgasm of the pluck
Never to cut them only guide them with cords

Soil wasn't plentiful at the Dunes
Nor was the enviornment kind to plants
Gusts kept all vegitation stunted 
Salt dehydrated all into a harded bark

Massive acres of Texas farmland surround the city
Miss was sure there would be a region to sneak a garden
A hidden cultivation of plants with access to irrigation
The harvest moon waned its orange tint
Forgotten & unused acres would be obvious as cultivated lands were weeks past harvest
_

Jewels had nurtured month-old-plants
Each nested on the bikes

Tonight was long ride to the outskirts
15 kilometers only to arrive at the border

These plants would find home or die
The roots could not sustain a return journey

Jordan welded a hitch for a one-wheel-trailer 
The pimped-position kept his feet outstresched ahead
Riding low against minimal air-resistance

Agitation on the plants unavoidabley to scar them with a sense of insecurity
Roots would grip peaceful-plains with a steadfastness from the experience 
_

Across town & down roads past horizons
Each truck passing honked
Calling them out as strangers noticed & remebered

Holligans up to no good
The plants probably drugs
Rolling together as pack 
_

Hours passed into moonlight

Jewels finally stopped arms skyward outstreched
Sensing the energy of a wishful-place

Miss affirmed with air-of-pride
'Yes 
'Deep-water in the air

'Jewels your ability is second-to-none
'You dear gem

Jordan keen to practical-ingenuities

Bikes were stashed inside an overgrown-roadside-drainage
Jordan always covered them with a dark tarp
He locked the set with his handy-chain

'The bikes will leave too obvious trail
'Without the bikes, if we move careful
'Passerbys won't distinguish the foot-path
_

Jewels carried her pepper-plant

The strand her variation based on the Witch's main-root
But it was heavily grafted with modifications

Peppers kept off parasites
Peppers helped keep meat
Leaves produced thick-smoke

10 Acres they walked single-file
All infested with dark-red-ticks
 
Mosquitos & gnats feasted 
Bugs bit at their salty-sweaty-bodies in a frenzy

A small hill loomed in the horizon 
Leakage off the hill made the path difficult

Mud caked their shoes till ankles
Shins sliced by serrated-plants

Jordan pointed at rusted-hinges of the gated hill shut for decades 
Overgrown the gate could only be hurdled

Signs of long-abadonment
An old camp chair next to a rusted-thru-tin-bin 
Decades-old-crushed-beer-cans crunched everywhere

Strewn about were odds-that-spoke-of-a-person who kept this place as private-quarters 

Miss commented still worn from the journey
'It must have been a miserable-fool 
'To keep this parcel-of-hell a lounge

Jordan said assured of the hill 
'This is definitely manmade

Tho molds of the hill that had longsince-become-organic
'The plains-dirt causes this shit-pit
'No cohesion to let the water run smooth

They twisted & curved, blazing a path up

Plants thick & greedy for space
Full of things that crawl & bite
Foliage 10-feet-high at places

The path broke to grassy knoll at its summit 
Plateau larger than what-looked-possible-from-below

A dark plane circle lay flush with the ground 

Miss had a habit of annoying them with her poetry
'A dark portal  
'Sacred pillar

'Reflection without ripples 
'Harvest-moon bore mirrored

Each soaked the sweat & tourtures of raw flesh
Little fish nibbled away the crusts of skin & ticks

Miss explained 
'The Downtown Memorial architect
'Once described the difficulty of the process 
'To engineer a water-mirror

~proof of mastery
'Where his words

'Here is one formed by more than happen-stance 
'The reflection adapts stabalizing to perfect reflection

The tamed-grass held a lush Kentucky Green, cool & soft 
Blades of it clung as moistured-gauze
The face of it a balm on tired, bit & sun-baked-flesh

Two hours past in preparation of the banks 
The four turned the soil with whatever was at hand

The removed grass replanted in care
So beautiful the summit vegetation

Jordan went retrieved the still-serviceable barbque-pit 
They alloted a section of the bank for the DIAGRAM constructed with washed-pebbles

Miss conducted rites over metals, wood, mineral
Marijuana was dashed over the top
Each hovered over the flames chanting after Miss

Plants first incensed to calm their nerves
Planted atop the rite materials as bed to the roots
Set to be untouched for a time

Dawn broke as all positioned at the DIAGRAM
Taken by sleep upon carpet of Kentucky Green

All looked across to other
Each sat legs-crossed settled-to-a-balance past comfort 

A large wick candle blazed-crackily in the center
Mint perked-attention of the passangers 
A thin-metaled couldron boiled hanging over the candle

Omnious sounds crept upon wakened concious 
Till it stood before their sense full-frontal

'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh
'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh

The words melded to their minds

Tho try as they might could not make out the words
Chants sync'd of mouth each mouth 

Moon bordered by stratus clouds

Jewels eyes burst-widely-open
! the arrival

'3 long years to summon thee
'Many have come & gone
'But only you we seek

'I am The Grand Prophet
Jewels spoke in a firm beauty
Adorned by all-fine-things

Her red-hair more gold as is sunset
A tiara laid by fine jewels & workmanship 
fish-bones, pearls & worked-gold

'A monks-life not wanted by any
'Paid in sacrifice to bless infinite-realms
'We beseech thee remember this chant

Suddenly conciousness whirled smokey as brew
All turned-together 

'Thru the hull of your reality Doom will breach portal
'Earths of every existence will be nullified

Swirled world righted 
Pulled back for a micro-instant

The five face-front Jewels
'Prepare
_

All woke slowly entranced by chant

Dryness-of-mouth 
Eyes welled by deep-tears-of-agony

Each across the other
Sore of crossed-legs

They drug themselves heavily to the banks of of the resivour
Not for hours did they speak

Jewels too put-out to set out a healing-vapor
All put-out & passed-out on-and-off

Unable to sleep deep thru pain-present-misery
_

Miss still slept 

The instant Jewels woke Miss collapsed of exhaustion

Jewel bore hard-amounts of dried-caked-blood in her throat 
The trance had lasted two days & nights

Prophet Jewels dealt them great harm 
To wretch them so wickedly in suffering-unparallel

~Prepare
A message that cost agony

Themselves they found were ones greatest enemy

Miss creaked out
'Dagon will be summoned
'but what force can stop
'a gateway built by
'thousands of years

'great minds of the world failed
'but pent-up power so great
'the order can only succeed

With no food they were forced
To make the laborsome-journey
To Jordan's nearest location

Next-winter-months spent at the Library

Winter a bitter-time of sunless-days under a moist frozen canopy 
Passive to the paths of constant-northern-gusts 

! FK-this-damn-stub
Jewels communicated by unmistakable gestures

Jewels argued with Miss in cabin-fever
Miss would often only rap Jewels on the head

All were getting cabin fever

Jordan spoke up
To the other four crammed in that hot but stuffy room

'Lets go back to the Dunes
'Rather have a few bad days
'Then to have all shitty ones

'For-fks-sake
'We all know the others bowel schedule

'Jewels shits first thing
'Todd always at 8:25
'Ben shits after lunch
'I shit before sleep

Ben snapped back annoyed
'I cant just pick up & leave
'Code takes time to set up
'Before I can think of walking away

'We might not be able to come back
'For a month or more likely

Todd asked
'We been here over a month

Ben got up from the computer
'Dude I tell you all the same things always
'I am refining mechanics

'But to refine the mechanics in code
'You got to take it apart

'Let me rebuild them then lets go
Ben had gotten back down to begin typing

'Wanted: 1/8 shrooms & lb whole-bean-coffee
click clack

Ben threw an accusative finger at the tatami-mats
'Jordan built those for streching
'Yall need to be busy doing that

'You might not know how we are supposed to 
~Prepare
'But as for me I got a damn good idea
'If I am meant to accomplish anything it is what I'm doing now

Jordan added
'None of my skills are new
'Far as my 
~Prepare
'Got that smack on tack

Todd felt ashamed
His strength was meditation & contemplation
~Prepare
To him felt a message he didn't need
_

Computer mainframe heated the utility-flat
Five monitors mounted on the wall

The boxes were mounted on the ceiling
He would control them via his laptop

He had 10 mounted of various shapes

Jewels & Jordan picked-up the shrooms & coffee mixture
Caffine is obnoxiously powerful but the brew would meld into the high
Ramifications enlongated an already long-trip

For six hours straight Miss convinced them to meditate 
Breatheing in the brew cooking over Jewels makeshift cooking candle

Miss instructed
'just a tttthhhh
'no hauking please

They streched each other & kept bound to the circle

With hardly any regiment to their lives
Miss's directions nearly welcome
Allowing an external-force complete responsibility
One settles within as a gardner awaits harvest

They suffered greatly for the benefit of one mission
One suffering the time in pursuit of the mission 
_

Ben used the trip to work out his code
For the routines to mesh in orgainically

Mechanics of code are finnicky & specific
Interfaces must have structural-soundess

Code must be industrial grade to support ever-present traffic 

Computer-nodes networked together by homogeneous unix kernels
Each would tap into the network on some distributive task

For this access-point to be discovered the cables would have to be dug
Until then he would have untraceable access to the northern & southern regions of the city's access to the net

Jewels had equiped a team of cats to drag a cable that served as a direct bridge to the Library
Library serving as the main proxy location with masked packets to appear from the computers

Files, messages or listings all sent from fake sources
Under-net listings soon burst with underground growth

Ben discovered network packets don't get analyzed nor routed until the arrival at central
He simply forged all his packed to be coming from the central address

People depended on this network for business transactions
They would devote boxes to represent them on the undernet

This code had to work well before he implemented it to replace running code on all the nodes
Network code that would require his boxes, which if removed would break that branch

Unix networks are stable, but the creative task was simple
Only encrypted tunnels to other tunnels in peer-2-peer

Only the two nodes would know of the connection
Only the process on each end could decrypt the packets
_

Miss always correct
Brew  potent

Ben took a backseat past weary exhausted drank coffee & smoked a blunt
Green Bull
Passangers prompted keystrokes in novel sophistication

Miss stated
'One enlightens all
'Entangled neural connections associated with the understanding
'Natural paths created simply 
'Cognition now remade to be native to a way
'Scientist woefully attribute to Instinct

Ben hacked away almost the last one up
Todd would never be defeated 
Event true shame as his journey was entirely internal

Masters of his method clocked their progression by length of meditation
_

The plants grew strong under care 
Soon a great-greenery amassed on the knoll

Bimonthly trips less necessary
Fine-tuned ecosystem 

Miss & Jewels would never leave until they were sure of all necessary for their next trip
To a more balanced & stable enviornment 

An great orange-tabby guarded the spot
It was a tom thru & thru

Plants coupled by the endless mice allowed this cat a heaven
Cat intelligently kept up the grounds from pests
_

All felt a calling near 

They would get a message soon
Today prepared for the experience 

Large fat pillar candle & hanging gallon of tea
Jordan set up a tarp to shade them in the day

0 united 00000000000000000000

Stillness slowly unfolded to chanting

Jewels aged-silver laid middle of the pond
Platform invisible as if floating

Others each passanger to her
Never before had they been joined-so 

She lead weary the same chants
Only the words now audible

'Dagon the dragon
'Is coming thru you

Their corporal bodies in-tune
Said-&-heard-thousands-of-times
A message now natural

Jewels burst emerald-orbs-up-at-to-them
The voice cracked in a way unaccustomed to many words

'You will lose your battle against Dagon
'You must find a way to kill Dagon's Image

'Each reality Dagon links an Image 
'A clone of its deity

'If Dagon killed in one reality
'The god will revert to its state in a previous realm
'Infinity upon infinity

'If Dagons previous-state-link destroyed 
'And 
'Dagon killed in the next realm passed into

'The chain would fail 

'Dagon's reincarnation obstructed
'The effect is only theortical 
'I believe the link will be shattered
'Dagon removed from this realities & portal severed

'A definite victory at the cost of your world

'Lot fated to fail 
'Learn to survive  

All melded as water-drained
Woken laid in unbroken circle

Chili-tea brewed with herbal-leaves
Sustained them quickly to bearable-state
_

Symbols
Now major part of their life

They would off-handedly-doodle DIAGRAMS

Stitched onto clothes
Flags to awaken a sleepy-passangers in alertness of remembrance
Symbol as anchor to keep their interaction in memory

That Prophet was laden with symbols
From Tiara down to the embroidered-skirt

Amassed but to each of them certain ones gripped them
Experience as if five one-being in an auditorium of thousands of silent impressions
_

~fk-the-world
Jules flipped-the-bird

Bonfire in fast from want of food
All at the Dunes returned home

Jordan lead them
'Our reality will be destroyed
'Others will likely forsee it
'On streets forever
'A movement is connected with a sign

Miss added in
'Agreed that is wise
'We must each await this
'Passanger to view some external-symbol
'There will be one & only one
'All others will be doubtful
'The right symbol will be obvious to all

Ben tossed in
'We were told to survive
'Ground-zero will be the most logical cover

Jewels signed
~Eye-of-the-hurricane 
~Or be nuke-city

Jordan continued
'The image must be secure
'Near the portal in a stable-enviornment

Todd joined
'Presence on the inside

'Why go thru years of chanting
'To give out a hopeless warning

'All-ever passed-in-this-existence 
'Consumed as meal for one-being-alone

'I mean to save our world as-well

Jordan looked up with a face
Reserved before a long rant
'The nest of the hive
'Always centers a queen 

'We know the school 
'Been there three-years
'Who over us best to break-in

Todd aggregated
'Ben & I will set up his network
'Miss, Jewels & Jordan will help
'Primarily, yall will map the place for entrances 

Miss complied
'Not all will be the same
'A symbol embedded with routes
'There will be one in each existence

Jordan lit up excited
'Finally 
'Xena 
'In my arms soon

All some-how creepily knew 
-that- 
About Jordan from their individual discoveries 

Xena, stuffed-giant-panda-used-for-humping 
Left in Jordan's locker

The regional network routed thru University Hospital 
Had one key to backdoor all the data and every service

A pattern would betray any key if enough traffic was sniffed 

The key would open a backdoor-to-control-all-the-machines 
 
Ben said 
'Todd you never asked me 
'Why I was chased that day

All chewed roasted-pepperoni 
Front of a bonfire in break-fast-feast

'I got access several terminals at the school
'Anytime I was at a computer I waited for a chance to create a listener
'A terminal that would wait for a connection on the network to run code

'It was my first big advancement in hacking

'Well a couple weeks before it was all set up
'Hid in the jacket-closet of Mrs. Stevens till everyone left on a Thurs 
'Stayed locked up in the room with a few bottles to pee in & some snacks

'My dad flip-ta-bich-&-slappped-me-good 
'For that hack session 
'Turned out my plan to get away with it flopped miserably

'When I get a chance I have to take it
'I set a pattern filter on all the keys
'It compared pre-encrypted traffic & post-encrypted traffic
'Shared any patterns so all nodes were updated
'If a single pattern unlocked them all it would print out a XOR version of the key

'Bots every-day 3am-5am

'I got impatient 
'After a month I got desperate

'A printer no one uses is setup in the back of the janitors-closet
'The closet is never locked but it is across from the Moniotor lounge

'I counted & waited
'All returned after their trolls

'I was in the middle of the hall
'They left to go deal with Todd

'I nearly opened the door
'Still tho I have no way of knowing

'That code should be cracked
'I have it written down & I know there are no errors

'Going to that school
'I agree to be our most important task

'With that key all traffic would be plain-text to me

Ben patted at Jordan's arm
'Maybe we sell ourselves too short
'Who else in the fk'n city 
'Could get access like that

'Get the data
'Plant an encrypted-bridge

Jordan gave him a coy-cock-back
'Well if its so simple 
'Why hasn't anyone else done it 

Ben responded 
'I never said it was simple

Insomnia was the soil of Ben's childhood

Night the time 
Dad popped-caps

If Ben didn't keep actively moving spots
Pops always managed to find him 
No matter how drunk he was

Popped-a-skull worse the-longer-it-took

So a decision to run a crossed-line 
Trespass forgotten after the haze-of-afternoon

Pops on a rant

cost of new school shoes
ones kicked aside-disrespectfully

I coulda ate McDonalds 
Not that shit-which for lunch
Two-mins to prepare on the-way-out

Ben easily avoided that clumsy-lunatic 
His dad's favorite state-of-being

Ben used the time to read
He built lights in various places
_

'If you didn't mark it
'There was no point 
'Have'n to remember it
'Der dipshit

His dad would lecture him
Accentuated by the alertness of a hurt
Some sensitive point to be taught over & over

'If there wasn't no point 
'Of have'n to remember it

'Then why the fuck 
'Would you read it boy

'We elect you
'Mayor Dipshit

Ben looked-up to his dad 
Despite his weaknesses as a father

Man cracked to the core
Stuck as single-parent
To provide all
In a hard world
_

His dad would steal textbooks from the city library
To learn Ben up on subtle-arts
Tricks too keen for school

Ben would wait in the car 
Always on rainy days

'Need a reason to stay hooded-up son 
'Two coats to steal-large
'Remember that one

Wisdom imparted in payment
Life guilt from the hazy memories
Witness to his own weakness

Gleaming as a redeemed-man does
Passing down a lesson-for-the-ages
Endorphins-high rewarded from evolution

Returned with two large textbooks of random sort
Displayed like he hunted-food for a starving-family

Dad always taking Ben as ingrate

'Listen shithead 
'When you get the balls 
'That drop and the skills like mine

'Only then 
'Do you deserve choice 
'Which kind of fruit-of-the-tree
'You be able to eat

Ben's dad was a muthrfkr

The type to fk around with you
Then leave a virgin stuck with a babe for 2 years

Gathered courage to come back to raise him single-handed
A fact that Ben used as pillar to keep the image of his father holy

Most the while
Kicked around in day-to-day bullshit

Nights like aeons memories haunt
Fresh memories of this father

Understood only then his lights would have been obvious
Kick-Ben-for-sport a technique that kept Ben awake & reading

Hard-put to pass time in a cupboard or cardboard-box

Ben eventually took up the tricks of his dad 
After-all most lessons were self-explanatory

Ben hoarded old unix-books like hot-cakes
About to be thrown out for out-of-date

Black-screen command-line-terminals
~For those who want to stay close to the kernel

~To lift up the shell
~To hear the C

Kerigan & Ritchie & Richard-Stevens 
Same enviornment on all computers
Unix-cloner on a small-silver-usb

Dad gave it as his birthday-gift
One at the corner store

Presented always as payment
After listening to his stories

'Shit you never know
'When shit gets real

'Cops be busting in
'We heard you 
~oink ~oink

'They search evidence

'& Where is the USB
'Full of all the evidence?

'4 Inches out of the puter
'Down your throat
'Before any seent you

'All incriminating-evidence 
'In your shit

Dad down-to-earth
_

Each year Pops needed less & less alcohol
His dad began to regret teaching the skill to steal

'Learnt is fine & well 
He would slurr & a slap 

'But boy tell-you-me 
'no MAn would choose 

'that bull-onie-bull-shit
'for some-real-life-skills

'piss on books
'only fools follow
Laugh'n maniacally as if front audience

Said book the one on-hand wrentched from him
All his highlights distored in the wrinkled-dried-paper
_

Pop phrases that always popped back into Ben's mind
'----like that fkn cop'
'----like your bitch ma'
'----like ....'
_

The five together around the large pit
Life taken in seriousness requires fast

Ben said accidentally interrupting the silence

'lets see anyone else 
'Takeover a whole region's traffic
'fknmuthrfkr

Food cool'n to cold in front
Busy in meditation or stationary-task

Hours of silence snowballs energies
Entangled to break an understanding

Stronger & stronger
Each passing second 

All united deep in trace

Ben on a laptop
Jewels would knit 
Todd would write down histories 
Jordan would keep the fire & cook
_

Ben's outburst dragged all
Back into the current situation

Starvation-bonds are exploited by the effect of pseudo-starvation
Hunger among smells-of-food will quick-trigger a state of pseudo-starvation
To fast from food is to trick the mind to get that food at all-costs

The state of starvation allows the host to be more receptive
Aun hear the voice of an Active Passanger
A voice heard by all present 

All would eat the cold food in deep gratitude
Somberness like ashe coats life smothered to extinction

Five pillars
Miss the center

All would be destroyed
First their reality
Dagon would portal onwards
In Quantum consumption 
Reality after reality
Till all possibility scarce
But the possibility of Dagon

Image a horizon-breaching presence

Todd theoried
'If the link strong enough to pass a god
'Surely ones would be capable for us four
'We will use Quantum portal against it

Their perpetual states of deterination
Allowed them full imersion of their praktice
Food at hand & Time to spare
Stengthen-past-mania each-to-the-other

Difficult at times when to attribute a work to yourself
Or mostly product of a silent-passanger

Quantum realities 
Benefit all as one
& One as all

Each action feeds into many-experiences 
Impulse understood as active-passanger

This heavy thought passed in pleas for energies & inspirations 
To be sent out for their purpose

Ghostly teachers
Students under often-masterful-hands 
Lessons only in whispers & impressions
_

To destroy a god is a rare chance
To succeed would then elevate themselves as gods
Only gods can destroy gods

Todd since a child devoted himself to edification

Meditation, supplication & fasts these methods of his craft 
Miss admited respect for Todd's intuition towards greater methods she knew of

These pools of energy bloomed in miracles in Todd's dream-state
He led lead hosts thru questions that filled holes of understanding
_

Typical Todd rant
'We will never know 
'A thing about anything

'As animal the world around
'Too grand for any to grasp 

'Points-of-perspective blind eyes
'In truncations of viewpoint

'I commit to morals
'Morals only modified 
'After any act itself
'To stand firm only 

'Quantum reactions lead to new doors
'Each moment can be made easily
'If made towards defined goals

'If my life till death
'Be towards the downfall of this cult

Possibly too inpired
By the mystic brew-de-la-divinacion


'The answers life gives us
'Understood in perspectives

'Jerk'n-off, playing-tag, school

'All sacrified
'For few activities 

'Mathematics & Kungfu

'Defining kinetic logic
'To build stable functions of properties 

'All morn towards kungfu
'Wake me into algebraic-groups 
_

Prayers chats to regroup mentalities
Towards certain pursuits

Repeated as if in echos 
Calling out for answer to an empty universe
_

Mathematical theory worked out in notepads
Exercise worked over & over
Often only in pursuit of the reason why they were asked
Reasons long-lost forgoteen
_

Ben said
'I have Dr. Yang Jwing Ming's compilation
'My dad stole them all 

'I also have alot of mathbooks
'Dad stole those for their size

Ben continued
'They are at a storage-container
'We could haul the lot with our bikes

Jordan washed in he circled the island 
Sense'n the mood of the monlolithic ocean

Jumping up to join-in
'Hella-doe-boys
'Book no-one uses
'slang-dat-shit 

'For some mad points
'With the Library 

'Dad stole to create a library to name after himself 
'Dad return books were ironically preserved so common the theft
_

** ** ** (stop)

Jewels flashed them down in lamp-code
Miss' voice couldn't carry past the bike

They turned to see three trucks charging from behind
Out this late with several choices of roads

Jordan hooted in a small call
'shit-gonna-git-real

! THEY TURNED AROUND & ARE SPEEDING BACK

He led them in a burst of resolute energy
Rolled up to the gate opened the door for the others to continue without delay

Getting off the bikes to pass them over fences
Till they got back out the other side

Houses abandoned since Hurricane Karma
Moldy rows of what Hurricanes can do

Jewels tome-busted the back-fences wide-enough for them to get thru

_

The rednecks weren't fucking-around
From the air a black mass dove into & thru the backyard in a woosh-of-disaster

Truck jumping on sup-dude-springs
New-dents amoung countless

Front a heavily-fortified hull that tore out a chunk of earth in a rain of dirt
Truck drifted-to-a-J over wet-dense-foliage of the overgrown yard.

!!! HONK 
!!! HONK HONK HONK

Dirt & Plants blasted over the collapsed fence

'Them there it is
! DATS
'Billys Bike!
! GIT EM

A hardy-bearded-oldman screeched
Stumbling-out drunk or dazed-stoopid-from-the-crash

'My late-wife
'Gave that do my grand-daughter

'You gonna pay!

Speech alone allowed the krew time to pass out & thru

Two-other-trucks distinctly-heard approaching
Grumbles of the enviornment in groan-of-the-rowdy-passage
_

Four naturally deduced their surrounding-situation
They hauled-ass onto the street back riding bikes

Movement as flock 
Jewels in the the lead 

They at times followed to great pain
Unable to keep up with Jewel's jukes

They curved in circle 
Second-to-last-house 

It kept a sound-structure after decades of decay

No-front-door gave quick-entry
Swift headlights passing just after

Todd whispered
!up-the-stairs

Stairs held but the passing felt-soggy

The trucks outside mad charges
Overestimating the strech 
Sure that in their dominant position
Like pigs you only got to circle them
_

Eventually the trucks pulled around

A voice shouted
'Jim you keep dat circling boy
'We gonna handle all here

A hoarse, cracking teen voice yeller
'Peep 'em
'Run-em-down-dead
'As christ on the cross

Others hooted
'Got my shotty

! pump-yer-ass-wit-salt
!!! ooooohhhhhwwwwwweeee 
!!! YIP
!!! saves-ya-to-feed-as-bacon-to-my-pigs

Five shadows moved as a group from one house to the next

At first having a great time in the bashing-deep-inspection

House by house naught time against them perceptiple at such levels of intoxication
At the umpteenth house the hunt became a labor

A hard & disgusting labor to search abadoned houses
Vomit-inducing sights met them unexpected


! you-wit-me
! bobby-go-wit-earl

'We got this 
'You check up
'Chk er down

Moments later a crash & bash down the stairs 

A crash at the stairs
! fuckaroo

'damn-fuck-cock-biter-stair

'jimmny-crickets-whore-of-a-mother


! BOBBY 
! EARL

! pull-er-ass-here
! help-me

! dumbass-dipshit-hurt-himself

Four others helped carry the wounded grey-beard to a truck

! HEY YOUS
! FUCK FUCKAROOS

! DIS HERE TRUCK
! CALL HER


!!! RUMBLE
!!! RUMBLE 
!!! RUMBLE

!!! DOOOMM
!!! HAMMMERRRR

Loud-screech lost itself in the maniacal throttle & Heavy Metal on 808s

Two on the sides of the truck let down a window-shield
The truck had a logo

~Bobbys Best
~WRECK & CLEANUP

'ole-mother-fucker
'is paid to clear this shit
'how-fucking-funny-is-that-boy

A shrill accusative sure it was heard 

! THiEVry

Justified the truck took out first the corners of the first house on the block
Several outshide would link the chains to the pillars of each house

! I-aINTA-WURKED-DiS-HaPPy-SINCE-VEGAS

One worker shouted glove on the right hand
A fith-of-something-cheap in his left hand
Leather-utility-belt hung a laborer-hammer

Pace & efficiency alarmed the group

'fuckohfuck
Jordan trapped in despair
'Gotta keep it real

Todd pointed thru the lookout window
'They left the hurt guy the smaller truck 

'Imma sneak up behind
'Take him down
'We only survive if we get a vechicle
'With bikes we lose
'There are too many of them

'Take over the truck then reverse here
'Throw the bikes in the bed

Jordan offered
'Ill back you up

Todd declined
'I move better alone
'Just be ready

Two creepers means double chance to ruin surprise
A chance that would immediately seal their fate

His failure becomes a distraction if nothing else

Hand-to-hand combat was only dependable solution
Any loud noise or extra-moment or honk would doom him
_

Out the kitchen window & along the front
He schemed his waypoints to an neighboring bush 

Crouched under the rear-cab window
Eat step careful 
Gravel was everywhere

If the driver-door was locked 
His luck would have ended

These drunk ass rednecks
Wouldn't have locked the door

In a solid-thrust he pulled the handle down 
The handle gave then held-firm

A voice inside rose
'what
! whatdafuck 

~Back Bed
Todd used the handle to swing himeself into the back bed

The truck lurched on
Todd now on a bull-of-a-ride
Thrown hard here-&-there

Guy caught-up in manual-transmission with one unusable foot
The speed increasing & he was drunk
Todd a bug at this back

Rednecks always have something in the bed sufficent to break a window
Todd grabbed down at metal-rod as the truck-bed lauched into his-shoulder

In the long pause of a fall 
Todd obliterated the back window 

Over-swung-rod continued to a red-line across the-head

! yyyyeaaaaoooohhhhhh

Driver experienced enough 
To not kill them with a slam to the breaks

Todd tossed inside none-the-less
Todd's hips hit the driver bashing his skull to the window
 
'ArGGRreh

He grunted stoopidly as they plowed still into a bush
Other truck still busy gathering-the-men having to make-way in a muddy-pit

Todd about to give the oldman a good one before the latter thought smart

The old-man too keen & had enough 
He lept out safetly on grass

Todd took the truck hard twice

Old-man crackled in the distance
!fuckingmanualmotherfucker
!gddamnu
!gears

Todd threw his handsign
Right leg & hand moved independent directed in a screeched reverse

Then the passanger passed
Todd kept the movement till the house

Old-man stalling the chase with a pickup
Truck-of-rednecks took the long way to meet up
Honking the attention of the truck that scouted

Todd's body screamed in pain of his previous ride
Another passanger took over screeching drifted-turns
_

Ben had overestimated the amount of books his dad stole

Jewels busy massaging Todd's wounds with a balm
Pepper-balm-stung-hot-in-a-scrub
Mint-oil-balm cleaned areas-of-distress
He lay in the back-seats wounded animal

Ben & Jordan loaded the bed with books 
A tarp bound the buldging mass
A few books were lost in the ride

Jordan had them park it as the Library
Todd would need a stable place to heal
They would make the dreary next hour crawl
_

'aye
! tack ! tack ! tack

Reluctant guard
Got up to the iwndow

!outtahere
!libraryclosed

Jordan yelled back
! truck in parking lot has hella-books

The guard did't believe him
Jordan wouldn't leave on his own accord

'Dude
'Im fucking serious
'Just look over there at that truck

Guard unbought
'Yeah & Yeah fk-off-asshole 
'libraryclosed

Jordan called back
'I dont want anything

Gaurd now woken completely up
'Fine lets go kid

Ready to hassle the kid

Jordan backed off the guard about to snap followed him
'fk with me today... 

Guard irritated turned his head
Entered the lot to see the books
Finally now understanding the little-shit-heads-words

'Oh fuck
'That is a shit-ton of books

0 BEN 00000000000000000000000

Walking on dark streets briskly
Working something mechanical in his hands


Quick-glances to each direction at the corner 
He wraped a bungee-cord around the post

Lasers now scanning the intersection for traffic

Passing cars would trigger a recording in a feed-alert fed via WiFi
An arm held a banded screen that lit up with the image of the feed

6 of them set up
2 minutes of maximum coverage

A warehouse at the docks sat alone
Waves crashed out in the bay in heavy sprays

Ocean a good place to ditch puter

Network scans always had this location in common
Location a matter of public inquiry

Weeks to prepare for this night
Cord-rolled & ropes flopped outside the backpack

'find the office
'find the gateway 
'hack the hack the gateway

'Run this cable along the gate
'Set it up to the city-utility-connector

'That green box at the end of the corner lot 

'I am going to upgrade their connection
'But I will use it as a network hub

The man new handsigns
He made them quickly 

'Four of us
'Quite an audience 

'Keep tabs on my wrist
'When it lights up to be sure 
'Nothing is missed

'Time to show you how real-i-keeps-it

Ben hazily thought he knows Jordan's quote
The late hour kept the alerts down

'Probed an oceanside-window last-week
'Imma enter thru that way

'Security checks up a few times a night
'No system to the timing

No-alerts finally came
Two minutes to scale the street-side fence

He only needed 20 seconds
Nike-Free soles molding to the fence he took up & over 
Pack-on at a running-start
Landing-quiety over the other side

Fences were his expertise a preferred hurdle to deter chasers 
Or catch-up someone who underestimated Ben's trained ability

Along the shadows of the fence 
One location to another could-hide-someone

Movements direct & pre-planned
At the base of the two-story office-building

A loory alerted & passed 

Window-ledge to a jump-hike-up-gets-arm-up 
To drag the remeaning 75% of body up to the roof
He would bowline-an anchor & repel down 
Knots came natural o him

These quiet-movements needing to be swift in a flow
Ben kept his Quigong (breathing-techniques)  

Next alert flushed with him against the window
Hidden from any point of view

He worked open a rusty window
Only open-enough for his body thru 

As soon as he entered he made a handsign

'Leave the escape-hatch open or closed?

'closed
'open best in life-threatening-situations where escape paramount

Ben shut the window
Inside smelled of a musty-warehouse
Tho this office-quarters

Family-portraits & anti-stress-toys 
Any disturbence could be serious

His pack was flush with his back
A laptop & wires were removed

His laptops were disposable
This would allow serval hours in a power-out 

But if a power-out persisted
The machine could only be powered on again physically

The gateway-box was in a locked-closet 
He withdrew a pack

Only after clumsy effort was the door opened
Hum-of-always-on-machines greeted him softly

A bogus label described this laptop as the company DNS server
! Keep on or speeds will slow ! 

He attached on the company-gateway
! Check DNS laptop 
! Is it powered on !

Gateway-box had a sticker which described the network details 
Someone wrote in marker the Internet-Service-Provider-Box

With that information configured into the kernel
There was no need to get into any computers

Man-In-The-Middle
Pretends to each end is the other end 

ISP->MitM->network
network->MitM->ISP


Laptop powered-off & the network cables unplugged
After the laptop booted he only then plugged the cables 
In the following schematic

A wet-napkin wiped the laptop over 
None of the alerts had been security

Ben woke from the dream & wrote 
One image called out to him
A photo on a clerk's desk

Family photo
On a sandy beach
~Pilgrims Pennesula
An icon of the characteristic-coastal-bay

He recognized that part of the coast
Long-since curious no road laid out to the Bluff
_
Jordan out snorkling with Todd
& Skaters each in turn
Oranges passed around
Two down at a time
Tide nice & calm 

Sky promised pleasantry
Each had opened their own-home
Or proved themselves to each other in other ways

Jordan answered Ben's inquiry
'Pilgrim's Pennensula
'Never heard of it

Ben said
'I know the shape of it
'It was south on the Bluff

Jordan smirked
'Well if it did exist 
'I would know about it
'& I have a good idea why
'I been out there for reconissence
_

All been up since last night
Water gleamed off round shoulders
_
Sports kept them constant on the move
Pull-ups essential for upper-body-strength 

It was their competition
To prove the worth of another

Leaping over a fence happens hourly at night
Feeder-by-turns launch others jumping on others-board & heaving-out an assisted leap
Glimpse-of-flying the crew would soar 

Pull-ups best eased into over time
Stretch following day mandatory 

  Grab something arms-distance over-head
  Lay out abdoman to strech it out

  Hold elbows over-head 
  Lean right & left
_ 
Jordan continued his story
'I get to the Bluff hella-before-dusk
'Ready to bail back to the city 
'Set up camp & nighted
'Believe-me I could hardly sleep
'This place was Neverland

'All soon as the sun went down
'Buzzes filled the air in swarms

'Worst night of my life
'Slept all night gripping shut my bag
'Bugs collieded into me all night

'A car would get suffocated by their guts
'If you go out there ... tssss

Todd felt a draw towards it
'Why dont we go tonight

Jordan face back 
'Da fk only to troll bro

Todd reassured him
'It will be a full moon
'That should keep the bugs down

Ben took up the challenge 
'I bet 4 supply trips
'The place was a landmark-tourist-attraction

Jordan took it
'Logically it would have been
'More ideal than the bay
'Bay took almost a century to clear out
'This would be a good first-landing

Well assured free-runs by both
'Prob different in this existence
_

They hitched a ride most of the way there
Walking their bikes along oceanside-highway

All broke their seperate ways
City teens ready to return to civilization

An over-sized truck pulled over eager to mak-use-the-bed
Scrachs & dents in that area a horded investment for reputation

An over-sized truck pulled over eager to mak-use-the-bed
'Yall taking a trip this late
Man at about 50 wearing a decade-old truckers-hat
Scrachs & dents in that area a horded investment for reputation

Jordan replied
'There is a party 
'Southside at the bluff
'Ben-here gots a date

Jordan nudged-openly at Ben to get the old man's hoot
Travel-moochers must be good company for karmas-sake

The old man jeered
'Throw yall bikes in the back
'Yall can come inside
'Cab big enough

'Fine someone gets laid tonight
'I aint got no possibility
'Old-hag divorced me
'Took everything but this truck

His meaty-hand slaped the dash hard proving-the-rig

Jordan always kept their packs in front when hitching
A good barrier & first-contact-pad if one had to jump-out

The old man cackled-loudgly the entire time 
'Any particular place on the bluff?

Ben put in
'HEB 
'we need to get a few things

The oldman parked out-front-the-store
'Im just around the corner
'If I see yall again I'll pick ya up

'Can we get you a 6-pack
Jordan asked crawling down

The oldman's eyes glinted
'Moonshine keeps my figure
_

Fresh supplies always hard-got
Stores hevanly place of plenty

Jewels gave props to Jordan
( good-hitch)

Jordan smiled back
'Yeah that geezer was legit 
'We can scout a base & camp eazy

'Wait till after dark
'If nothing then camp
_

The cashier looked upset by their selection
Obnoxious in cost & too-much to carry

'Those bikes yours out front
The cashier jeered at their bags

Ben asked the cashier 
'There is a party here tonight
'Pilgrims Pennesnula

The worker started-up 
His long oily hair stuck to him
He turned & looked side-to-side to face them

Bandages behind-his-ears hid-tattoos

'Kay first never mention that here
'Kay idiots

He leant in closer
'Tonight 
~at midnight yall
~is-gonna-be
~HELLA

The clerk sang into a low-whisper
'Just keep on Jalisco straight after the barrier

The deep-folds-of-skin on his neck leaked oily sweat
'Its gonna be tits 
'So wassup girl see-you-tonight

Worker appraised Jewels figure
Muscular legs in stockings & shorts
_

'A-holy-fk-this-wind
Jordan grunted away down Jalisco
Main street of the town to terminate here
At a straight-shot back to the city

Ben shouted up
'Better-than-bugs

Jordan replied
'Stash sup with bikes
'Help find a bush
'In eyeshot of the barrier

Todd turned back
'Sounds-like-a-plan

Todd chirped walking in a staggard-line
'I wonder 
'What possibilities would have been
'Without that hitch

'So many random-events
'Create such drastic trajectories

Jewels faced him
~Or they 
~Drawn to us
_

The sting of sand brought their packs up to protect their faces


A mile & a half past the barrier that terminated the main road
A muddy pit-hole-place too extreme for any vehicle
Themselves near rather go thru the ocean-side-thickets

Jordan related
'This parth of the bay 
'Hit-gold round the 60s
'Karma swept it all away

Ground a gray-clay 
It stuck to your feet in heaps

Streaks smeared along their calves

Sand no-longer a blight to them
Wind blocked by the extreme up & downs of the passage
_

Jordan turned bac

Todd pointed out to a hill
'I bet we can see the bay from there
'There are plenty of deer paths

Jewels dove at the invitation
A nervous wreck to keep her tome clean

Thickets dense but animal-traffic a web of paths
The hilltop was visible most times

Miss stopped them with a whistle
(whiirp whiirp)

Jewels set her pack down to knell onto
The bush of dense aromatic herb

Using clippers & twine Jewels made four sachets
(rare)
(good luck)

All wore a leather cord to drape-sachets 
Bags of dried herbs & charms for forturne

Todd regaining strength commented
'This place aint so great to travel in
'Even-without the bugs you hated Jordan

Jordan defended
'Yeah these paths must be seasonal

Rest & refreshments then they mounted packs
Hilltop gained after a dozen minutes of climbing thicket-trunks

Top suddenly broke-away to panorama
Dark shoreline illuminated under moon
Great waves of the ocean hurled into the land

Outcrops of dark boulders in the distance

Jordan lamented
'Buildings about 50 feet 
'Off that barnacle outcropping
'I can see its form is definitely a rectangle
'You can see the straight shadows of the roofs

Ben 
'You should have known better ole-boy
'How long you gonna survive if you bet against people like me
_

Clouds eventually parted after they returned with their supply-packs
The open hilltop still enshrouded by the thickets 
Their hammocks & tents set out on the sand-worn-platau

They blazed a path only open-enough for the teens to squeeze thru
Back on the road & down to the coast by 10pm

~Pilgrim Pene... 
A sign half-buried-by-an-accumulating dune to the side

Ben pulled it out
'The exact same logo

Jewels
<trippy>

Miss was like a cat & fell asleep a long time ago in her belly

All buildings degraded from decades of mis-keep
STill heavily-boarded to block all entrance

Ben gave-up
'To get inside any of these would require
'Half the building torn down

Four back up the hill before any neared
Bayside in an off-the-map area

Five of them at the lookout
! vroooooooom 
Trucks illuminated the scene from their look-out
Hilltop under clouded sky

Tricked-to-legit-trucks crawled & mudded
Firewood netted in their beds

Each helped haul the other in a train
A chain to snake way over the treacherous path

Snake-like darted out onto the beach
Rocks & sand sprayed as they linked & scatterd-out

Jay-drifting released nets rocketing the wood into a scattered pile

Over 100 in celebration
Trucks now parked

Light flicked from enormous bonfires
Buildings now all operable in service

Booths of live animals
Fortune telling & street-magicians

In merriment wasted on alcohol

A truck would haul a tethered cage open only at the front
It would jolt off to lauch sacrifices out to sea

First chickens then pigs then sheep
_

A great bonfire was built
Hoot & rite all sacrificed gas from their tanks in tithes

Coiled around the bonfire in summons audible carried on winds
_

A dark object arose from the sea
Long form of the LochNess dragon

It approached the erected wood
In a flash of a strike
It sniped half the body of a man
Which it crunched happily

In a great roar it stood upon hind legs
As it fell it bloomed a flame-lashing-as-wet-tongue

LochNess returned to the deep

Aquatic-beings arose from the deep 
To dance drink & mate in merriment

LochNess awaited 
Tentacles to the shallows

Tentacles of all sizes
_

Esoteric Order of Dagon robesmen rose from the deep
Encircled the crowd in a chant
Odd-aquatic-hums of deep-water

Line uncoiled hand-bound
Towards the deep sea near out-cropping

Men & Women in odd-orgy
Attached by tentacles & plump-sacks

All unkoothe

Tentacles hairy to suck delight
In prescion of pleasures hundred-fold

Taken in the air, thru waves, under deep
Sand stinging in the wind

Escasty to feed LochNess
Todd then saw the LOCHNAR
Green glow feeding as well

On ornamental-necklace encirlce the rod of the orb
Golden scales glinted under its green-light

Set in folded gold & other fine-ways
A hermaphadite god enlaid upon a wave

Impossible detail opened to Todd
Empowered by present energies

Miss interrupted Todds deep-scorn
'It has met you
'Once it chooses
'Only kills or submits

'Orb of the Seer
'Or as you know it

'LOCHNAR

Rolls of flesh attached to tentacles
Glinted on & off by moonlight
Foamy-scenes of garganteuam-enviornment
Sexuality thick in the air

Monstrosity flailed in the high-winds
To increased delight-of-cultist

Foam spouted out of the orafices
Hotly onto the naked bodys

Great shocks of electricity sparked-arcs
One-tentacle-to-the-other

Pain & pleasured-content

A time the air a hot steam-of-it
Heat a sauna to de-tox the day

Hair smacked-wet-in-lumps
Hours into the night
After they were able to peel-away
From the shock first-sight

Moans & the orb shone bright-green the night
Each in turn devoured by the being
Locked in a stasis of electricity
Awakened in full-bloom-of-lust
In that freshness devoured tastily

Under hot-tarps mid-day 
Till sleep could come
_

Miss spoke avoiding the name of it
'Only rumor that
'It from any straight-line
'Can attract one directly

De-camped over a light-fire for breakfast-dinner
Moon already bright in the night

Todd admitted
'I saw it
'As if it was in front of me
'It lit up all as micro-moon
'Beams drew me to see closely

Miss continued
'I am stranger
'To that glory
'view-of-godhood

Miss spoke loud for all to hear
'Thru it the portals will open
'It will seek us & at that time
'We need to act upon it naturally

Jordan put in as reminder
'Just hope that our bikes
'Is where we left em

Jewels punched him
~curse on you
~rosetta 
Jewels no-joke hailed her bike a Mary

Ben spoke up
'Easy last night was trippy
'Todd is either going to have his last nights
'Or we are going to get ditched in Todds leap with divinity

Todd in thoughts on terrific implications
Damn the fortune of diety
All best blow away easily
Slaves of their followers

_

After de-camping the beaches as before
Prove all it had been a drug-side-effect

Deer paths were plenty in parallel to the road
Rested they made a pleasant way to the bikes

Not a bug been seen at all
A fox out smiling with crab-dinner
The chaff of sand in their trek

5 Students in a library on the second floor
Overlooking the floor below

Government officals stood around observing
Children presented honorably their findings

As classmates successfully tracked down
Items of legend to world-wide-press

Himself too-smart for the officials
In a feint he relifted the ring from the small box

Immediately before the boxes collected

The officals promptly said their wearing-daily-disclaimer
'You will have no more dealings with these matters
'Any attempt would be a loss of your family-line
'You service to this government will not be forgotten

Military Police allowed them the arrogance as thugs no one would cross them
The upper-floor a swarm in relish of the spoils

Kid was quick out
Now at bottom level

'Hey I saw you
One of the mates ran up

'You didn't give yours
The mate shoved him back towards the government

'You will get all our families killed
Undaunted pushed the outmatched-child off 

Vengeful the student yelled
! He took the LOCHNAR
! He took the LOCHNAR

He was out submersed into the streets
LOCHNAR a trusted-friend after months

He recovered several of the rings
Red-gem called to him in drunken-state

Gem in possession of several thugs
'Heard you asking about ruby jewlery
One said as the thugs circled the kids-krew

'You got the ruby
The kid provoked back

The man flashed up into a rage into a bait
& The two parties fought

LOCHNAR in the end
Subdued the thugs

Ruby aun jumped away under a desk
Kid knelt down to retrieve the ruby 

Out came a little spider

'oh sir oh sir
'we serve we serve

'to you to you
'sacrifice sacrifice

The gray of the hairs in semblance
Majestic mane of the little spider

Mane as ring of royal-anscenstry

'Eight Legs
'Many eyes
'All yours

Kid thought after a second agreed compliance
Ruby rebuild spider kingdom

Past midnight but sweating in the humid night
Texas out on the farmland decades since flattened

! CAR

Flat-lands allowed plenty warning of a car at night
Crew dove into some hiding
Aided by the camo attached to their packs
_

Scotty was with him with his new girl
Scotty was solid legit so all caved

He would lose his virginity to night
In a so-called-garden-of-magic the perfect place

The girl Kitty had perfect form which oozed plesantly
Her behind on the tandem with her feet out for a strech

All under the load they long-since acustomed
Jewels had the Tome, firewood for Jordan, Ben had tarps,
Black-hood-in-full-parachute Todd hauled-all-else
_

Grouped together they easily covered themselves in an open space
Hardly cars out this late of night in deep country
They get out there enough in the day

A old one-pump-station marked the midway
Always visted on the trips to store up

The pack past it all dark & shutdown
Familiar smell grumbled Jordan's stomach

Jordan heartless had filled Todds-trailer
Now they were all thankful for it

Harvest Moon bright
Headlights noticeable for miles

Dark clouds would pass in the rapid bay-winds
The contrast empowered Jewels to embue that spirit
Powerful random-concoctions procreated explosions 
_

Brew state would give them powerful dreams
Smoke state would inspire them fore journeys
Balm state would calm them to deep meditations
Edible state would purge them before fast

Scotty explained this to the girl
As loudly as he could under strain

Due to the feminine-lure of drugs
5 Often blitzed in those states

/////////////////////////////////
Trading with demons of the abyss
Recieving Innsmouth-esk trophies full of weed

Ideas to actions aun objects
Post state in awe of the reality of such things

Jewels recipies were endless
Each part of her day a different masterpiece cohalenance

Jordan would prepare & stragize 
He would recieve objects like locks

Ben would code on
Reformed to computer understanding

Todd would meditate-kung-fu
Dilligent in some body-hardening-task

This hill allowed them an endless supply of weed
So ya-know they had a heap of it

Drugs & labor interwined by love
/////////////////////////////////

Jewels prepared a faggot
	weed, flowers, dried herbs
	weed, driftwood, dried-sea-plant
	honey, leaf, tabacco

Jordan's bonfire raged into a deep slumber of red coals
Jewels set the cone & they all drank her tea

All linked together around the smoke 
Wind came from all directions
Smoke randomly passed onto each
Each facing away from the other

In a circle as when laid down
Head closest to the cone

Vibes resonated the night in tune with the late-summer-beatles
Girl blushed an awe to a state-of-being she only read about

Scotty was one lucky ginger to have deserved her
All sexuality perked a crowded hill-top 

Only small-talk to get business done as they inspected their plants
Todd chewed on the cluster of leaves mint-favorite & cane
Cross-legged he formed a comfortable desk to write in his book

Jeweles motherly cared one after the other
Pepper plants robust in the vigor
Numerous & each strove to be bigger & moister than the last
They sprung up in a column each-supported-by-other
Thick stalks difficult aun with machete
Miss long since retired to Jewels stomach

Jordan out below in the shed
Drainage maintained into a stream
Now after all those months of trials
Till one stream, clear as night, passed thru

Ben on his laptop now powered off the local-solar-battery
He worked out the mechanics of the system engineered to be the tunnel-work
The next generations of the region in total secrecy

Mountain-tops in snow-caped Asia
Teen on a trail-run to the ridge

Path of it only difficult & narrow
Death consequence of mis-composure

Night put this path impassable
No place to sit no where near enough to lay
Little clue on the correct path down
Slopes all drastic & divergent
Smoothe to prevent retrace on this maze

Their ancestors kept this vale sacred
Now as mission for the boldest-of-heart

To take these two buckets
To supply goverment goons of the villiage 
Himself their slave

'In this reality everyone
'Is a slave

The male sensitive to the moods of the passanger
'A lone mountain spring
'Drip by drip by drip 
'Only a small pool
'Large enough for these two buckets

Sturdy iron-wood-staff laid in steel & gold
This sacred relic allowed to be non-stripped
Symbol of the subjection & servitude of their mountain god

This was training to for staff management of maintaining balance despite much
'These fools know little of us
'This task used to train our hero

'The one prophisized would be the one
'Who never falls to the pits of Spring

'All think that person would mean it a forgiener
'But I have yet to fall in the pits all these years

Steel rungs of each end of the staff attached the buckets
Week after week trails to train him in destiny

Paid too good to stop
No other bold enough

Every runner has died 
Without exception

Yet this movement his art
Bondaged as all in opressed-existence

Out here naught any could touch him
Out here he was king of the world
Him & the world as far as eye could see
No trail could break over the ridge
So it was stay in this desolate place 
Until you decide to return back to a meal
_

Todd amazed by the mastery of complex movements

Hip training warm-ups were the vital key
Low to the ground made the path passable

Buckets anchor points
Movements kung-fu in a mastery
Todd vicariously moved instructed

Animal forms applicable to the present obstacle
Camel Crane Monkey Russian Mantis  

Staff balanced on his neck he calsped his palms
Handsigns swiftly-executed 
Aun a dab of precious olive-oil

'Slavery will not break me
'Here subjucated as all

'Here I am your master 
'You as purported powerful-being
'Tho more blessed you sure to be

'More time to master
'When all else gone

'Tai Chi Qi Gong

'Breathe in
'keep your center
'Breathe out & move

'Extend or contract
'Breathe in & keep your center

'Staff allows 1/8 leverage
'Formed to double-polar-end 
A stable four vector anchor

He tightened one hand & pulled with the other
With a whip of the back, the steel ignited against a rock

Once proud boulder now chipped-off a good chunk

'Here one these runs
'I reign King
'This is a personal journey
'An epic that never has left
'how do you all call it
~my own backyard

Todd was then able to speak
'I am of a tribe of Corpus
'Five of us live as nomads

'A comsic deity known as Dagon
'Will consume all possibility connected

Todd felt the lump down his throat

'We are fated to lose to him
'Then we have kill his-image 
'For another demension tasked to kill him
'God summoned slowly as monsters
'Till it aggregates into full form

'The LOCHNAR 
'A green orb
'Has chosen me

'A power which when recieved will empower all
'If you have be ready to act upon moons-green-glow

Dusk of mid-autumn night
Bayside school tricking over shit
Jewels catching her breath
All else in hopes to talk to her
Crowd by crowd has stopped during the day
Not one of them chose to leave yet

All teens released from school
With nothing else to do

Scotty met other dealers & they powwow dealt
He would hustle edibles Jewels made only at a high price

'Dese my friend
'For that special night
'When all needs to be right
'I promise you
'This will take you out of misery
'& Into a lande of pleasant pastures of plenty

'fk-off-mormon
'go sell a cunt
Skater-dealer scoffed tho did not remove his gaze
'how long they good for

'Scotty dont you worry about that
'Jewels that girl, yeah her
'She perdicted you would need them soon

'Hell even strangers know that about me
'They tell me everyday

He handed over for two

Skate-pack stayed 
After the posers & wanna-bes left

They were rich kids from the south
Two groups skaters & the dealers
From the same school of spoiled-have-plenty

Leader darkskin-glinted-in-sweat rolled up
He managed to give Jewels some impressions

'How about dem Black & Mild 
'Abe 
'Put that rotation yo

Jewels shot back a tip-of the head
Standing aside her bike
Her smile a big-flash-of-white

The tallest one, an asian, spoke up
'We all go to Carol

'We hit a few spots after this one
'The ones that close down after dusk
'No rent-a-cops

He passed Jewels first the wooden-tipped cigar
The smoke let out in a thick cloud
All reeked pleasantly of tabbacoo-strong-mellow-odor
_

Hot summer breeze of salty air 
Sweat drained-unending off forehead & back

All chill hid behind a building 

A short one said
'You should amatuer for Miller
'You are that good 

Jewels counter
~do it for love

Jewels let off an expression of tenious
13 Now light-headed weary state reknewed

The short one braved a question
'What is your worst fall

Then a few more
'Can you kick-flip-180-brake
'What do you do to get hops like that

All answered spaced thru the next 6 hours & three spots

Herd of fearless near a mob

All rolled up a fatty 
Then hit two more spots on the way to a friends

13 Bodies piled into a room, living-room, garage
Dead-tired & able to pass out on anything

Dealers had pieced home
Only the skaters there inside

Four of them mad bed around band equipment

The morning was a sweep
Step-dad triggered

Tired each parted after that
To some place they didn't want to take the pack

Meet up spots eventually found to meet-up later

Ben passed out a few usbs
Several were connected by the end of the day 

Time for a lazy afternoon ride to a spot
Crash-out wake up well-after-necessary
.
.
.
Dagons Eve was the day they decided they must take action
Then the powers were sure to converge at the University Hospital

Till then they lived life as it presented itself
East Texas mountainous hills river-length on tube

Remote strechs only take on horse
Lunchtime at a particular ebb

Jewels picked plants with Jordan
No tail just wandering with foliage

Passage that suited them best
To a small valley between trees

A lily flower
Powerful to a wiccan

Grew lone on a perch
High & unstable

Unreachable cept for her abnormal strength
Up-top drew in more curiously
Signs of wiccan conjury apparent
Left after decades of lonliness

Satchets attached to trunks of trees
Idols & tokens to ward off others

Poisonous thickets & large-maned-spiders
Wild cats hissed there revealed a harem 

Nest of the felines in the groves of a thick marijuana bush
Signs now led Jewels on a search that would not end until the 
Cave discovered

As if by magic
Over a slight hump of nasty poisonous thorns

World now a peaceful mellow meadow
Cottage to the deep rear 
Great well of water out front

She found the back ways not used for much time
But used for much longer as to give natural way

Three after time worried increased by shrooms 
In marshmello & colors kelidoscope they passed

Shocked aun in their state at the sight of a witch's cottage
Smell of aromatic herbs proved the truth more than sight

A snake of great lengths uncoild from around the decrepit door
Slithered to the bushes to the rear to watch from a distance

Jewels obvious witch
Crows cawed others to view approach
Tome greater than any heard
Caw of which will echoe here-fore

Witches are all drastically-different
Yet their common themes astoundingly apparent

What this witch built lasted in a cute-beauty
Preserved only the better for the wear

A large cauldron over the kitchen hearth
Great-beam of sun shown down
Four all could easily look up to the sky
Ceiling high & sustained by an old-pecan
Chimeny great & anchored well
Rear-double-doors suited to barrow out the ashes

A island-table boulder lay flat & stable

Trapped triggered
Arrows flung & whipped-roots-lashed
All poisonous 

~FEAR A WITCH
~AS SNAKE
~AFTER DEATH

Message carved over the slab that released the traps
Poisonous after all these decades

Jewles & the krew all minor-severe
Plants out front clean out the wound legit

Jewels in a lust ran off after ointment

Jordan asked confused
'da-fk wit her

Ben saw
'Every witchs grave
'Is another witches treasure
_

Jordan manange to aid the place
Placements of splices of thorns
Now made for only two passages
Too large for a grown-adult

Todd directed his Kung-Fu to the energies of the field
Learned the lessons of the soil & rocks & root

Ben hacked away at something or other

Jewels remained in awe
This a palace no less the dunes

Granted the dunes had ancient wealth
This place pure dedication of one-woman

Spirit now thrived as Jewels invigorated presence
Tabacco will bring many to partake

There then conversate
Jewels & Witch

Audible-ghasts-aun-boys-hear
Miss would not come out in fear

Jewels made proper burial of her bones
She died of tumors working till the end

Pyre built & lit
Ceremony of passing

Tomes of Jewels now had two sides
She passed her sisters celestial
In the manner of bright flame
Under full mooon

They got rides by friends & never returned
Friends as theirs expected nothing less

Pack easy to stay a while
A day then supplies ran out
As well as their stomach for pecans 

Jewels always kept pouches of oils & spices & herbs
She could make anything delicious until then

Wild herbs & pecan salads 

Line of Felines trained on point to their duties for Jewels
Principals passed down genereation to generation in royal line
Now that mixted over generations with great many stray lovers

Cats now able to run basic things
Water plants 
Debug here
Pick & dry & store here

Chores cats tho distracted constantly 
Managed eventually to complete
Even if one act took a week

Mice population so strong only the idiots
Were the daily price of the felines

This part of the forest supporting 
Hundreds of thousand mice

Royal guard mice
Had to win against a cat
That means scar a cat

Then they are renamed after the cat
Mice are excellent spies
They know everything

Other mice mock the scars
When a cat is tagged a fool

A new mouse gets nobility
In the wordless ways of mice-speak
.
.
.
Ride back in a truck
The guy didn't speak much
As if obligated to take the crew

Back in Corpus by morning
They were stuck 5 hours midway

Come of the highway to the crashing coasts of the bay
Next days only light sun & chilly relaxation

Moonshine now the rave there at their private-party
This blew-up the underscene with Ben usb traffic

They installed his kernel
Used it as a source to communicate
Each part of the other

A TOR snowball of clock-work traffic
End-to-End OTOPSK encrypted-packets

Network now unable to be stopped

Need-for-Privacy overtake the entire network
Each computer a bridge to the network

What Ben had in mind would only insure the inevitable
On Dagon's Eve he would re-do the entire network
It will work to well than to revert back to a fix

Entire region to-be the most secure place to exchange information
End-Game for Ben

His characteristic image now a symbol of revolution anti-society
Code proven to be unbreachable to any impactful degree

Hours & hours poured into creation of the unix-kernel-build-world
Simple methods of verification & encryption techniques all cloned 

Ben's network is connected to by most devices
Login to share data totally secure in an automatic setup
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Workplace gossip near single-handed destroyed society
Friday only a mornful day to many remembrances
\\\\\\\\
Authorities first openly declared it an easy example win
Frustrated they had to conceed difficulty to the public
This all the rage for the streets world-over
Code passing as if on global winds to all hemeshperes
It was just a better way to net thru society

A DJ came in
Lots of regions from the crew
Opened it to the all
Creating a bridge

All the krews 
Over the entire city
Had time to type it up

City still kicking-it all came here
The party was wild & it lasted for many days

The last man standing never left
Still on that hammock every-night over the cliff

Jewels spiked a potent haze to the drink
Alochol multiplied the effects

Aun who frequented immediately forever-lost how to find this place

But Ben signed Titties & had a supwerstar night
Todd & Jordan & Jewels couldn't not be envious
Especially Jewels who was expected to have attention

Party named USB 
USB or you dont get in

Ben had the cats all run a usb thru dd-machines
Before he fed any for the night

They all left with a different usb
System preloaded to kick off if plugged in

Ben was dawned the White Rabbit
Pick-of-the-litter adorned with floppy-ears
Gave a sloppy-suck to king Ben crowed in carrots
Crown due to Jewels quick humor & action
Spectation the climax of the twilight-night

That night a legend of which many of its forms would echoe
Always each spring-break out Padre Island
Carrot King & Bunny was somthing only locals understood
'Follow the White Rabbit
Accompained the thought
.
.
.
Library outside middle-school kid sat
He was talking to some older-smart-kids

They only listened politely
Tho their facial-expressions wouldn't suite

Charles said to them
'Dreams
'Dreams are quantum passages to other worlds
'In dreams I seen things that dont even exist as concepts

Silence only answered
Boys waiting for their rides to arrive

'Think what you want but chew on this

'Matter can not be created nor destroyed

'All great men stand on shoulders of giants

Boy last to get picked-up

Jordan went over
'Yeah you are right
'Smart brain you got

The mom arrived & the boy couldn't reply

Dagon Eve holiday was a region-wide
Open-celebration at the capitol bay

Ritualistic sacrifice
Pigs or calves roasted
Carved as one of the members of the group 

Accompanied by a feast of much more
All out in the streets with pits

Walk down the bayside ways to try morsels
A happy-time with never semblance of violence
All harsh times were blown off & settled as a mass

One cam of age here when one realized in a shock
What the day's celebration really meant

This the Eve of Dagon
A preparty meant to be bigger than the party
This year discovered as victim to arrogance

'special
An unspoken foreboding

Children would all pack up
Mobs of them at a time

If a child tagged you 
'special

They would in waves attack whoever tagged 
Vengeful best keep docile & let them have their fun
_

No one missed Dagon Eve on the bay
But this night they would use that to break-in to the University Hospital from the school
They would enter how they exited 
From there they would take the elevator upward

An overrun alley was perfect to tarp the bikes
Rustle of chains brought the attention of police

PoPo blupping in demands for attention thugs of society
'Yeah your screwed give-up night-ruined

They always moved in packs like waves

'Hey what you doing back there
Lights hit them imediately

Crew lifted each other over the wall onto a parking lot of levels 
_

Another set of cops already chasing the crew up the levels to the last

~hey-get-da-fgaaa-away

~hey timmy
~you got them called out breaking that window

There was a scuffle in a tried action to penalize the comment

~oh shit 
~hey its Jewels

Immediately the personality of the pack of skaters hid up on the highest level
No where to go & the PoPo would eventually discover & trap them

First an inner group whispered upon accordance came up with a plan
PoPo just shined lights out from the layer under

Cop cursing
~if that bitch gets chosen 
~these brats are gonna pay

All in one voice 10+ yelled
'SSSSPPPPPPPPPEEEEECCCCIIIAAALLL

Children are especially violent to cops
Most cops too stubborn but even that hardly mattered

Special cops were a death-sentance
This cop would erreously brag he alone survived

Shit-pants in a flight for life out to get-the-fk-out

Same crew we always ran into
_

Ben shouted over his shoulder as they left
'Tell everyone pings x 1000 12 hours tonight  

Themselves taken as crazy to turn down their way to the bay
Stopping to show off a trick one of the noob-freshmen broke a window

Alerting cops to the area
_

Bikes were checked on

Jewels
Graced Mary
_

Thru the window as if they passed thru it every day since
First stop was Jordan's locker at the extreme end of school

They talked - not quiet- on the empty halls
Sure this place was deserted

A light sprang on
The four froze

'I heard some-tin
A giant shadow clambered about

A voice far from the light muttered
'Dagon Eve
'dim 
'whit

The shadows warped the head as if it so tiny on an enourmous torso with diapers
.
.
.
Jordan whispered angrily
'gdmit-fk-it
'told yall shut-the-fk-up

Ben brushed it off neceissarily

They arrived at the locker & Jordan forgot the past entirely
Entirely as well discarding the present
Panda Bear ravished out in middle hallway
Others never quite getting enough space away

Dusty panda now tied in a rope-hug around Jordan on his back over his pack
'girl i know you missed this
Jordan said coyly in a very out-of-character disagreement

Way down to the closet without incident
.
.
.
Jordan struggled at this time than at any in his life
He submitted to the handsign & was then able to work-it-out
Locks on the closet door opened one after other

All-too-familiar hall as if time here remains constant
Streaks of blood painted out in great stains

The girl who shit, the girls with periods that week, along with many patients
Died when tracked down the aquatic-monsters
Dragged here and consumed all-else falling to feed the hive

Body parts in small-pieces saturated the musty-tunnel with a morbid-revulsion

Todd went first now having learnt his lesson
He would wipe then climb
He wiped a way for them to the higher floors
One each only after the other arrived

10 Floors passed only after trial
Two legs anchored out helped the climb

Without idea of what to expect
Crew acted & worked over any obstacle

All had their usb & made clones as they explored the offices
The corner offices were the most interesting

Each could easily pick the locks

Next, openly-argued as the most important stop
Ben tilted led the way to the closet

For his algorithmn to work
This old code must have accomplished
What he with an army of hosts could not crack

The long passage drew sweat to Ben's brow
All kept their distance
Ben this anxious to flip his shit

Ben opened a door to a corner room
Darkness felt out only an empty printer

The code was either defunct or the answer thrown away
Ben flipped-his-shit the printer flung here
Then it flung there

Until at last & eventually landing on a soft thud
Fall softened with a layer of paper

Ben lifted them up
Aun dark the closet the white paper revealed
Patterns he programed

Hundreds of them
All papers in the same form

Ben knew each one of these was a repeated key
His most grateful desire was now accomplished

He gave each of them a stack of the papers
'Guard these with your lives

Ben updated their USB each as able helped Ben's dream
30 Mins & Double-checks he reworked the kernel
Redistributed with the network-root 
To used the survelient-system against itself

Key salted to a higher level never to be cracked
Method now used only OTOPSK salts to exchange data
Nodes updated & already building unix-kernel-worlds

Toggable network accessed by ease
Launched from this platform entirely secure

The LOCHNAR seen in a picture of a penthouse-view

Miss instructed
'That is the highest floor
'I have only been there once
'There lies a great terrror


That was all she would say 
Rue of fates hand dealt

To preserve strength they took the elevator up to the penthouse
Ben hacked in and recommanded the wiring to all them up

Despite an initial drop
Ben swore would never have been fatal
The doors opened up to an enourmous suite

Penthouse cieling as if standing under the ocean itself
Dark tinted oddly shaped glass roof

A great pool of water laid out in a thin pool
White sand lay in the center as a lone island

LOCHNAR resonated a green light that hummed in energy

'Miss so you have returned
'With Jewels the Treasure of Ebb-ave-lee

A form on the sand which seemed warped drift wood
Sprung to life in a silent slither under the water
Up to the sandy bank

Todd meant to position himself closest to the LOCHNAR
He took a forward stance to the left for a flank

The creature hissed all too quick for them to get a look of the form
'Prophecy calls Jewels here for sacrifice

A flash dove at Jewels 
Frieght-train shut down

In full halt
Painful for so great a creature

Its form now laid out in a broken mass

Todd now clutching the scepter of the LOCHNAR
To fulfill prophecy
LOCHNAR obiedient slave
Shrunk to a swallow only seen by Todd

All else captivated by the form
Shoulders of an oxen yet aspect of whale
Tentacled arms long & barnacled dangled-loosely 
Ink drooled past embarassment from sides of lush lips the liquid color of coral

Moments later a dart shot out of the room
It came from the shaft in a blurr
The long dash Jewels weight countered
Todd & Ben held in a grip

Todd held the creature at bay
'You will not be able to go after them
'We will kill you if you break grip

Two boys tore at it in fervor to respect

Pepper-bomb quickly incapacitated the creature 
Jewels dropped the creature a 
~double-wide-fk-off

Each nose in a mucus crusty & bloddy 

Todd croaked out
'Go go

Ben cried out in a throw
The MASTER-key-usb thrown to Jewels

It was over the creature was horrendous
The fight was over

Only in the brazen exposed all-in
Arrogance led to its downfall

Todd & Ben had time to admire its evil
Holding the creature long enough for Jewels & Jordan to long-since-escape

Face front a dark panorama of ocean 
Fresh gusts pouring thru drifting white sand
_

The beast composed of a chain of torsos
Ribcage & Arms stiched in muscles as a snake
Sets upon sets of arms each with steel gloves

The bottom of ribcage wout feed out the neck connected to the next-ribcage
Skin of it a milky-softness of a new-born the rosy aspect of it unsettling

Nose were grown on each shoulder
Noses sniffed in individual-character
Extermely interested in as much as dogs

The sitching required to form such a creature done with fine-precision
The arms held them securely but the heavy-metal hands out-of-situation

Each of the nails was painted differently in a nacissistic finesee
