# CEMETERY DRIVE

Expand'n urban areas
Breached to every boundary

To some long lost & tucked away
Cemetary down the wooded dirt path

Woods condense'n to thicket more & more
The closer the boy & his dog approached 

Down the timeworn dirt path
Under large trees & beneath emense ferns 

In an ancient strength 
Lost since lost
In most of the world

A beohemoth that takes breath
From all who look upon it
Power pooled from the souls
Of the dead of that place

Cemectary grounds immaculate 
Tombstones worn smooth

Day after day
This remote place
Called out
To the boy & his dog

World around him consumed
By the greedy god of Capitilism

Dogs must be on leash & Cross only here
Concrete regulations clutched all in its grasp


Sit'n on the hump of a grassy knoll
The caretaker came into view

Tall & Ancient as the trees of the place
The man loomed over a broom

Today the boy decided
To venture to approach him

' Is it all right that I come here 
' So often?
The boy approached from behind

The caretaker turnt from his work
His elderly eyes took him in 
With compassionante consideration

But before a word was spoken
His dog barked in manner extremely curiouos

The echoes came from a distance source
The alarmed boy took off without second thought

Towards the direction in a fluster
Leave'n the question unanswered 

On & On he ran 
Till his shirt stuck to his body in sweat
The barks further & further

Open slopes
Up & Down

Rarely under shade
To keep off the noon sun

A center hill rose
Higher & higher at every slope

The mound hosted great mosleums
From it tombstones spread
Out in all directions

Great locks all secured 
In the keyless fashion of the dead

He had never been this deep into the cememtary
But he had no consideration of curiosities

At the center of where all else seemed to serve
Loomed a mosleum unquetionably the greatest

Its two great metal doors flung open
The echoes of the dog resonat'n
From in between them

#################
# MOSOLEUM ECHOES

The master mosoleum
Built as a temple
Of which all centered

Its ancient & gothic form
Streaked with the black tears of time

Without hesitation the boy ran inside
Towards the distant barks of his dog

Inside beams of colored light 
From high arced windows shown down

Upon the centerpiece of it all
A large stairwell that ended in blackness

The stairs continued down & down endlessly
To cold depths in total black

The walls of earthen make
The stone stairs concaved with use

He new his enviornment
Only by the sense of touch

Countless acts of faith
As he took hurried steps

Hunger ate at the boy
Thirst froze to a chill

Hours passed to more
The barks now possible imaginations

His last step took him down
Hurt & tumbled he finally stop'd

There in prostrated pain
He closed his eyes & slept



The boy woke to unbearable silence
Proof the dog was lost

The dog wouldn't have passed him
The only option was to proceed

Hunger nor cold bothered him
The daze of exhaustion 
Bore him relief of all pain

Fever took him 
He laid down and slept

He woke in a sweat alarmed
A fever this deep would likely kill him

Tears eyes burned 
As the boy wept uncontrollably
To fall again to sleep

The boy woke to find 
That the stairs slightly simmered

Enlive'n he rushed down the stairs
At a confident pace

The light grew with the hours
Until deeper the source of the light was discovered

It was the moss all around
Deeper depths made it more luminecient

After the third rest
He was able to see clearly
Faint have'n drunk all the rationed water

He realized that the stones were warmer
The temperature was not caused by fever

The boy stripped off the wet shirt
Thirst now unbearable
But enlighted by the weight of sickness being lifted
He even let a few laughs out

Roots grew from the earthen walls 
Dangled down in inexplicable ways

Ahead in the deep a nightly glow 
The evanesence of it rose up the distance steps

Like the thick smokey way of a costal fog
The dank mustiness of the air was now gone

Near the last of the footsteps protruded
The handle of a casket imbeded in the earthen walls

Maybe it was the look of the polished in use
But passing the boy gave it a pull

The handle extended out like a door
A wrapped body in that classical mummy way

The mumified arms of crossed a sword at the breast
The boy took the hilt & sword from the scabbard

The dusty & cobwebbed hilt 
That drag of fine crafted metal
As the sword left the sheath
A pure clear ring as a crystal glass

The metal of the blade
Reflected brilliantly the light

The boy pushed in the casket back into position respectfully
Then descended the last of the steps into mossy grounds

###################
# WORLD OF THE DEAD

The bottom of the steps lead
Onto mossy grounds of a tunnel

The low ceiling dangled roots
Closer now to the roots he could see

Little hairs of the rootlike-plants
Emitted the dust that feel like feathers to the ground

To assimilate with the mass of fog
That glowed in the nightly ways of green blue & purple

Gusts blew from the end of the tunnel
In the refreshing assurace of a way out

At the end of the tunnel the boy
Broke into an open area 

An arcd biome where light fell in particles
Of the high looming sealing & floated down

Lighting up the air like microsopic falling stars
Until they fell in a fog all about that encompassed open spaces
With no walls in sight

Orbs of yellow dangled down from vines
Like giant oranges

Plants glowed in the moist way of deep ocean foliage
Gentle & soft as the skin of an inocent babe unbleach from sunrays

The size of it larger than mountain valleys

He descended down from the point of it
The mount of the stairs its pinnacle

In the pillowy moss lead sets
Of distinct paw prints

The sword was heavy in his arm
Strained his muscles already
But the strain gave him confindence

To continue on the mysertious path
Track'n his dog down with reknewed hope

Down the stairwell he had much time to think
Of what in life is worth put'n all on the line

He conintued because he knew
This was the only path he could take

The air was humid to the point
He needed to pee every hour

The rocks in this place had the similarity of barnacles
Organisms cultivated the stone as homes
They protrudded out like great boulders

Large bulbous fruit
Skin so thin the bitter
Complemented the taste of the juice
The richness of the juice was complex & energize'n

The grounds were not like the culter of forests
Where all life found inter-twined for resources

All life here kept to respecatble distance
The moss the lower layer
From which all else seemed to favor

He saw several hummingbirds
They were quick & glowed of the juice
So as to appear as the fruit
Until they in instant flew off

The boy now in his underwear
His clothes in a bundle around his back

Each plant he had seen
Was unique as if it belonged to no species

#############
# INHABITANTS

The boy called out to his dog
Sound seemed sucked away into the fog

The boy became too sleepy to care
Drunken vision that creeped unsuspecting on him 

Until it was a wave that already set
But him at the crest already destined to crash deep down


Waking was more of a struggle to dominate
The drunkeness that was life living under the dead

Time stripped of the restraints civilization straps on it
To try and force it as a constant

Day Hour Second
None had any use here

Life much nearer to the natural
Now & Past all that remained to matter

Soupy food was brought to him
The sip of it something unsettle'n

Slipping in & out
Until after a deep rest he became alert



GHASTLY GHOULS
SURROUNDED HIM

Forms abstract yet mechanical
Oceanic organisms perched up in odd ways

~ boy you wake
~ to serve us


The one that spoke had large eyes
Perched upon fingerbones worked by sinuewy vineline muscles

To a head that was bulbous like an octopus
Gleaming out a large tentacle mouth was a large humanlike tounge

Pink & fleshy in that only-human way
Against the chromatic flesh of the creature

The neck was the hipbone
Attached to the spine & ribcage

One arm like contrapion moved on to top
Its 6 five-node fingers moved as one does speaking

A five feemer long leg 
Rooted on a polar double foot

The other leg at the other end of the ribcage
Shorter that ended in a crab-like claw formed of jawbones

The ribcage a gastly jellyfish like clear tenacle mass
That enveloped a definitely human brain

~ boy you will not look at me like that
~ twain you value you last breathe

The boy bounced up from the moss 
That carpeted this cavelike domocile

He kept a defensive life position
Of the creepers around him

His eyes could no longer behold the vile things
Permiting only perephrial consideration

In a whipping flash the thing cluctched his bleeding jaw
Forcing the boy to meet the eyes of the creature

~ show me with respect & love
~ or die

' Where is my dog
' You gangly muthrfkrs

The boy shouted as he grabbed the claw appendage 
In a heave rooted by his planted legs

The boy whirled the creature around him crashing against any others in proximity
Releasing the thing to crash in a fumble against the rock wall

' Where is my dog
The boy shouted again as he walked backwards to the opening

The other ceatures taken into a startled paralysis
Made no move to approach he who had dismantled the leader

~ WHAT MEATY BROOTH DOETH THE DOG DELIVER
The dismembered leader laughed vengful whooping way

The boy was out of the room
& Thru the corridors 

His inner thighs 
Where the meat met his underwear

Soon began to cry out in burning sensation
As the skin rashed where it met piss-soaked cotton

The structure was made out of stones
Crablike spiders scruttled inside their shelters in fear

This dwelling bound the stones together strongly
All that was to do was place to stones as one saw fit

Inenvitably the spiderlikes would host themelves
& Bind the structure into a solid

Discarded outside with the hilt deep in the moss
The blade reflected the bluegreen light of the fog around it

# WORLD OF THE DEAD

The bottom of the steps lead
Onto mossy grounds of a tunnel

The low ceiling dangled roots

Little hairs of the rootlike-plants
Emitted the dust that feel like feathers to the ground

To assimilate with the mass of fog
That glowed in the nightly ways of green blue & purple

The sword was heavy in his arm straining his muscles already
But the strain gave him confindence

To continue on the mysertious path that had no return

Down the stairwell he had much time to think
The doors & only exit were great & unbreachable

Screams in that narrow temple 
Would doubtfully penetrate this wall

That is why he conintued
It would only be after he was reunited with his dog

That he would be able to begin the quest
Out of this place



The rocks in this place had the similarity of barnacles
Organisms cultivated the stone as homes

Those domes seemed more houselike than the domes
Of the ants of the Overworld



Gusts blew from the end of the tunnel
In the refreshing assurace of a way out

But he knew that down so deep
A century of work would be needed to rise up


At the end of the tunnel the boy
Broke into an open area 

An arcd biome where light fell in particles
Of the high looming sealing & floated down

Lighting up the air like microsopic falling stars
Until they fell in a fog all about that encompassed open spaces
With no walls in sight

Orbs of yellow dangled down from vines
Like giant oranges

Plants glowed in the moist way of deep ocean foliage
Gentle & soft as the skin of an inocent babe unbleach from sunrays

The boy now in his underwear & no longer thirsty
Each breath drenched in humidity 

His thirst long forgotten & now replaced
With the need to urinate

Of all what most stuck clearly in the boy's mind
Every plant was unique in all but the moss
