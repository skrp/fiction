The family lived in a large house
Not all had the same mother but all the same father

A teenage boy was introduced to the family
There were skirmishes, broken-billards-rods & acceptance

A werewolf came to the city with a companion
Uncontested it took the victims but this family stood against it

Ten with tens more joined they roamed the city
Goat'n the werewolf to focus on them & from them only would take its victims

Not all the victims turned but from theirs 
They always did to the werewolfs delight

Until the armies becamed matched
& They die'n father summoned from another portal

With the magicks of the last-stand & the trojan-horse betrayal
The werewolf was finally slain by the family to their continued respect
_

The horror lay in the constant vigilance of the werewolf-compaion
Its attacks ever-loom'n but never expected against people least expected

As if its goal was to feed off of the pain from its victims
The lord & apprentice kept their dominion by tears
