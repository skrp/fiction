# Driscoll

The classroom was overcrowded and subsequently loud & riotous.
Benny kept to himself but his odd personality had ways of escapeing supression.

Sandra sat at a location in his peripherals. 
He had never made an attempt to talk to her, nor did he wish too.

The sight of her just made him happy, and her presence was pleasant.
Her crisp yet smooth voice. 

Hair in a wavy that way to hold her face elusive in lunar fashions.
The whole sight of her would illuminate all in a soft blue.


Mr. Jackson was forcifully entertaining as always. 
His class was the main attraction of the school. 
He was prided as a celebrity in his field who decesended like Jesus to teach the Lambs.

But the act & puff didn't fool many of the students.

Benny was talking around in disorder as the rest.
Mr. Jackson had taken a few students into the hall. 
They trickled back holding their prized gifts.

Due to the overstacked room, Benny was aside the door.
He was always the first seen. Like a sore spot on a masterpiece.
Tho the location was so terrible, Mr. Jackson wouldn't permit to degrade his prized students.

Alright, come get your pizza!  Mr Jackson lauded.
Without looking at Benny, the teacher held up his hand & let the other side of the class first.

By the time Benny got to the pickings all on the tray were accumulated to a finger-sized scrap.
He returned to his seat before he eyed two more pizzas to the other side of the hall.

In the disorder he got up to get a slice.
The other students await'n in line glared at him returning to his seat.
A large slice stacked with cheese.

To the embarassment of Mr. Jackson the pizzas weren't enough.
The students in line could do the fractions themeselves. 

No matter how good the pizza, there is a distinct distaste under hateful glares.
Benny tried to offer the half-eaten slice over to no avail.

The principal rushed in.
'There is a student in the hall that wont leave until he gets accepted into your classroom.
'The reporters are already here Mr. Jackson.

The teacher hurried out of the classroom to make his appearance.

# Field Trip
Their field trip was a ramble downtown.
The whole class in a 2-3 student wide train.

Benny was given rollerblades to wear by Mr. Jackson.
He adorned them happily as the only one rolling.

At the head of the line they crossed into downtown.
The boys held a race, but in a sudden they stopped following.
The group instead pointed & laughed.

Benny turned around & realized the ground dropped off into a slope.
His velocity was too fast for him and the end was inevitable.

The speed increased, and by subtle hints of ethereal sources, Benny criss-crossed in diagonal fashion.
Those manuvers held him over the grip of speed-wobbles as he ventered the crest of the slope.

Streets perpendicular were full of traffic. 
By that same source, the boy took to the far side to then sharply change parallel with the streets.
The rollerblades took him switftly between accosted pedestrians & into a cemented meeting yard held for outside displays & communion for the Medical University.

By the time the rest of the class arrived, security guards had tracked Benny down.
His explainations were ignored & they stuck with Benny. 
Who was now barefoot with the laced rollerblades hanging around his neck.

The fieldtrip was to that very location. 
Benny's classmates now looked at him with an admirable awe.
All had seen the death-defying maneuvers executed with confident responses.
Now accompanied by offical escorts, one on each side.
Even Mr. Jackson looked at Benny differently, but all was already set in motion.

# Selection

Half of the class was to accompany the guards & Benny.
To visit the abandoned middle school.
In the basement of the University.

The dozen walked in at first curiously.
Elated that they over others were extended in their trip.

Then the click & clang of the old metal doors shut.
The atmosphere are dark musty yellows illuminated the decrepet school name
'DRISCOL 
	7'

The pack like sheep followed to the other end.
Dark wide stairwells led to subterrainian floors.

Benny could not fathom how any student could be compelled to come to this school.
Abandoned, but all was well worn by decades of use by students.

The pack huddled near the dimly lit lights.
Then realized the security escorts were gone.

All immediately were taken with the primal sense of fear.
Lurch'n on them like a cat upon a mouse who had thought themself secure.

In such indisputable circumstances the heart allows paralysis.
To submit passively into anesthesia thru whatever end.

The security guards now emerged from the central stairwell.
Their heads were now revealed as inordinarily small.
Their buldge'n bodies naked & only clothed like babies in diapers.

The lidless eyes of the two now unmasked into a mania that was confident & sure of no escape.
A smaller dwarf came up from behind drag'n linked chains.

The pack of kids too fightened to move.
Life had taken a vile turn that their experience had no response towards.

Suscepitble to third-party inception from have'n reaped its rewards, Benny again echoed its advice.
He flung the hefty rollerblades at the nearest meglomaniac.
The tied set horse-shoed into a wrap around greet'n the ugly face with a smack.

Benny turned foot & ran off down the dark hallway.
This spured the entire pack to disperse frantically as chickens with no head.
##################
# Sandra

The hallway nearest to Benny's escape wasn't the one they had entered thru, but schools retain a circular mirror-like fashion.
When the ruckus was at a distance, he stopped to look thru the narrow-vertical window of a classdoor door.

Only the hall from which they entered has sparsely lit lights.
Now that purchased benefit of the surety of closed options.
Narrow beams of light exposed the horizantal tall-as-hand slits that were ground level.
Each window was double pane'd. Even if the window was broken, the metal net would prevent the exterior-consequently-thicker window from being breached.
The entire place was revealed as built for dark purpose.

An odd jittering accomanined with the light tappings of many small feet. 
The sound of a tribe of mocasined-wearing gnomes scuttle'n excitedly.

Benny quickly took refuge in the open but recessed space between a narrow break in locker sets.
The sounds passed by, but he knew nothing had passed. 
The ramble continued on till it was followed by a audible plop & a shriek.

Benny had been too caught up in the escape, in the march dictated by confident impressions, to notice who had followed him.
The shriek was Sandras.

Benny jerked out his head saw a giant many limbed mamalian creature who aspect was crafted after a spider.
The dim light revealed baby hands worn into sharp clawed pads. 
Main body a stiched hunchback with a sag'n obeese stomach.

The face was veiled to be naught but stiched ears where inplace of all human orafices.
Cheeks sagged low like a dog, insectlick pop'n noises erupted from it as it extended straight into a mechanically structed jaw with a gape that swallowed Sandra whole.
The action was taken without the relief of a scream from the victim.
Her mouth had been foam'n over in a puss-like bubble'n. 

Five kids with her recoiled back in horror to run backwards.
To the clutches of a nest of creatures.

The saggy body of the monster now full was inorganically spin'n around & around.
Benny horror-struck to the sight, think of Sandra being ground into a fine pulp.
Then the creature emitted an orgasmic cry in pleasure of pain.
A sound of the ripp'n of skin & thick drip of blood feel from its anus.
A sack enveloped in a grey mass the color of hour-old umbilical greased out into a moist plop.
With its many nodes it lifted up the sack & spun it around & around again.
Shoot'n from its penis a thick pale yellowish thread until the sack was wrapped.
In a continued motion it shot at the ceiling to stick the suspended sack. 
The creature climbed up the sack & scuttled excited on the ceil'n in hope for more prey.

The rest of the commotion was took place around the turn.
Benny braved in a hope, spung from that ethereal source, that Sandra was still alive.

Barefoot his feetpads fell noiselessly.
He stuck his hands into the porous sack.
The film of it gave off a putrid stench.
Only with great effort did he unstick his hands.
The whole as tensed in the coil that kept it suspended from the cieling.
He could not break it barehanded.

Despite the hurl of his stomach in the act he felt for Sandra's head.
He found it positioned at the bottom, the coils only at each shoulder.

His hands did not have the strenght the make a rip in the sack.
Back on the ground, in the pool of blood & slime, he met his feet to his hands & leveraged his bodies muscles to force an oppose'n rip.

The sack burst like a zit.
The putride pusslike fill erupted envelope'n him completely.

He fell back gasp'n but only swallow'n.
He vomited convulsely.

A strangled gasp came in a bubble'n from Sandra.
In the dim light he saw her mutated head.

Her left eye was an erupted crater. 
Her right eye gruesomely ready to burst extended out farther than her nose.
Head was already completely hairless.
The mass of it below like as in a shower drain.

Benny cried out in helpless horror.
She was alive & would life.
But only ever as this.

He closed her swelled dark tounge back into her mouth.
Then he wrapped his strong right arm around her neck and squeezed it with aid of his left.

The remain'n eye burst into his face.
But he let it drip, eyes closed, unhindered.
Until he was sure Sandra was finally dead.

Benny's muck covered handed only smeared his face.
His eyes were suck together in the jelly.

In a frantic panic he stripped off his clothes.
To his unaffected boxers which he used as a rag.

The voice demanded him to pick up all his things & wipe down the evidence of his presence.
He complied, but he was extrememly paranoid of the return of the creature.

###################
# Acceptance 
Benny retreated into an inner classroom.
He continued to cry & vomit in dry heaves.
Unavoidably he passed out his mind unable to digest the past events.

A dreamless darkness spanned for infinities.
To wake to a calmness.
Utterly alone but the events digested in the way only dreams can.
The ethereal passanger now disconnected.

Cocoonlike eggshells were in the far corner.
They had long-since burst & were caked in a cystal like layer.

Above he could make out the white tiled ceilings typical of all schools.
Unnaturally, there were still remnants of gum-darts.
Used gum stuck in a square folded inside with a straighted metal staple stuck in the center.
This device if flung up would stick to those tiles.

Once, by narc of his classmates, Mr. Jackson had him clean the entire classroom of such things.
In preparation for his interview on national television on location.
Using a ladder it took him the entire class period.
But it was a work he took pleasure in as he busy'd himself independent of have'n to nod to the Mr. Jackass's bullshit rants.

The population as mostly all fluff conspired by the entire school use'n Mr. Jackson as the frontman.
All the the most genius doctors in the field of bio-mechanical & bio-trasmutation hearlded from this school, the successor of Driscoll, and the Medical University.

Dark were the depths of the ocean which moved the doctors to such prestige.
Benny knew he only had experienced the topmost layer.
In him he knew there was no escape this would be his fate.
Only on his decisions towards the true course would his effect be maximized.

With wit & hardened resolve he decided his course.
There was no hope of retreat.

Clear-headed he remembered the metal gates that would be extended at the entrance.
Now he understood the dark recesses on each side as rest'n places for guard'n sentinels.

Benny ripped a rusted chair leg off.
The tip pointed in a wicked way.

Unfasten'd a woode'n desk also.
Use'n his unwearable soaked socks he bound the now vacant fasten holes to his arm as a shield.

Then he climbed up on the teachers desk.
Lifted easily the white tile and hoisted himself up.

Odd how life wraps back around itself in purpose.

# Companionship

Eyes will accusstom to total darkness in an odd way itself the source of light.
Sharp outlines mayhap only imagined.

Pillars of the internal frame of the buildings broke the vast open space.
The air here saturated with dust, but seemed underneath to be fresh.

Bones layered the ground in patches.
As if something had hoisted up its meal & devoured on the spot.

Baby bones ever present in the heaps.
Whatever was up here in this layer made its meat off the monsters.

Benny's neck hairs immediately stood on end.
He had been enroute with the wind that carried fresh air.

Then he heard a scuttle of many nodes towards his direction from behind.
He turned & crouched with his back to a frame-pillar.

Almost 3 feet of space of height allowed narrowed in the vectors of attack.
From the lightless blackness a form was made out.
From pillar to pillar it encircled him from about 20 feet.
The shape enlonged like a snake.

Benny followed the form.
Noiselessly shift'n keep'n back to the pillar.

Then the form vanished inexplicably.
Its form entered from oneside of the pillar, but didn't emerge from the other side.

Slight sounds came closer from no discernable direction.
Benny felt his neckhairs again & instantly jumped back sheild forward to put the pillar between where he sensed the creature.

Before Benny's ass hit the square ceiling frame, a bolt struck the desk shudder'n thru his entire body.
The claw was deeply embedded into the wood.

Benny finally hit ass hard, but was immediately wrenched forward as the bolt recoiled in an attempt to free itself.
Burdend by Benny's weight the creature fell from its hold on the ceiling.

Upside down & close enough for Benny to smeel it.
With one power thrust the rusted point bit into flesh like butter as if it met only fat.

A pitch of a squeel rake'd his mind.
The beast reeled at him & met his forehead in a headbutt.

This burst blood from Benny's nose and flung him back free'n the claw from the desk.
Dazed Benny scrambled against the nearest pillar.

The creature didn't continue its attack, but retreated to the darkness.
Towards the corner where the fresh air came.

Benny only had to follow the stench of what putrid fluid came from its wound.
His resolve was to end this creature to gain experience to enlighten his resolve.

A piched patched whine continued in a whimper.
The huddled mass work'n frantically in the beam of a crack of light from the ceiling below.

The gleam of metal from a needle & motion of thread'n obvious.
'muuuuurrrrbbbllcccccccccciiiiiiiiiiiiii' [mercy]
'muuuuurrrrbbbllcccccccccciiiiiiiiiiiiii' [mercy]

The creature emitted at Benny's advancement.

'muuuuurrrrbbbllcccccccccciiiiiiiiiiiiii' [mercy]
'aaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiidddehhhhhhhhuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu...' [aide you]

The spiked tail homogenous to its centepedelike body.
Countless childarms as legs end'n in disformed hands.
Three arms held up its head maneuver it like a neck.
The head of it two feet from its body.

The face of it kept a similar vile reconstruction.
The eyeball sockets overlaid with skin.

The four eyeballs, cordlike veins sprung from the bare nose sockets, & held up by splitered tongues.
Spit spewed from the cry of the noise it made from the great gap between the ceramic fangs in its mouth.

'nnnneeeeoooooooo' [no]
'eeeeehhhssssaaaapppppe' [escape]
'nnnnneeeoooosssssttttttaaaahhhhpp' [no stop]

The tail tap'd the border of the large fan whir'n.
Benny indeed had expect that way a hop of escape.

Keep'n distance he stood in front of the fans.
Multilayered & rapid the fans layered the pipeline nearly three feet in diameter.
The end of it bent up towards a curved exit.

Bone fragments below the exhaust were obvious evidences of past attempts.
Benny, always face'n the monster, picked up a large femur bone to test it himself.

Unhindered the whir of the great blades struct the bone.
He slanted the bone to create a spearlike edge.

'What do I do?'
The boy submitted to ask.

The arms turned the ghastly wrinkled neck.
'sssssssuuuuuuurrrrrr' 
'vvvvvvvvvvvhhhhhhhiiiiiivvvvveeee' [survive]
'rrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeevvvvvvvvvv'
'eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeegggggggggghhhhhhaaaa' [revenge]

The mass of the creature heave'n up & down in the unnatural movements of its organic breathe'n.
The creature resigned to the fate the boy choose helpless.
'nnnnoooooo' [no]
'hhhhhheeeeeeaaaaalllllleeehh' [heal]
'nnnnnoooo' [no]
'ppppppaaaaaaaiiiinnnnn' [pain]

The doctors could rework the muslces & nerves.
Only evolution, with eons, could develope the self-healing inherint in natural biology.

# Mission

Benny crouched across from the creature for a great time decide'n.
His escape appeared to be gone unnoticed.
There were no search'n movements below.

The two choices before him were to follow this creature in his hunt for a doctor.
Aide'n the monster in a revenge that disrupt this evil.
Or to kill the creature to be sure his escape not alerted.

Hunger still stalled by the emptied stomach now as rock.
Lunch long since ejected.

An ethereal wisdom lingered.
The boy had no idea of this enviornment.
If this creature after years could not escape.

Then the only path of success would be to aid this monster.
Together they could be strong enough to get revenge.
